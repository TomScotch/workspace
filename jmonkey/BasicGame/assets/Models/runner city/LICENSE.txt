You are free to use this digital asset in your own creations,

A digital asset, in this instance, means both the model and 
the textures.


EXCEPTION ****************************************************

I've used a texture from cgtextures.com for the windows in the 
buildings.

It is the file - HighRiseNight0063_1_L.jpg

You will have to download it from the cgtextures website and reload 
it into the material to get the full effect.
I can't redistrbute it here.
