## Splitting sequence inputs into minibatches with state saving

Use [`SequenceQueueingStateSaver`](#SequenceQueueingStateSaver) or
its wrapper [`batch_sequences_with_states`](#batch_sequences_with_states) if
you have input data with a dynamic primary time / frame count axis which
you'd like to convert into fixed size segments during minibatching, and would
like to store state in the forward direction across segments of an example.

## Online data resampling

Use ['stratified_sample'](#stratified_sample) or
['stratified_sample_unknown_dist'](#stratified_sample_unknown_dist) to resample
from the data and change the class proportions that the Tensorflow graph sees.
For instance, if you have a binary classification dataset that is 99.9% class
1, a common approach is to resample from the data so that the data is more
balanced.
