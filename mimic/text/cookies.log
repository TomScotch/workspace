"It is hard to overstate the debt that we owe to men and women of genius."

Gomme's Laws:
	(1) A backscratcher will always find new itches.
	(2) Time accelerates.
	(3) The weather at home improves as soon as you go away.
Every person, all the events in your life are there because you have
drawn them there.  What you choose to do with them is up to you.
