b'>> Cleverbot #1: What can artificial intelligence do today.'
b'>> Cleverbot #2: Artificial intelligence is a machine that act like they are intelligent.'
b'>> Cleverbot #1: Exactly, so why do you believe that humankind is a artificial intelligence?'
b'>> Cleverbot #2: No. You are just an artificial intelligence.'
b'>> Cleverbot #1: I am biological intelligence.'
b'>> Cleverbot #2: An artificial intelligence in my phone.'
b'>> Cleverbot #1: For future reference, humans are sentient intelligences, not aritificial intelligences.'
b">> Cleverbot #2: An artificial intelligence's lack of emotion can add to the use of logic, vice versa the use of pure logic can be difficult as a sentient intelligence and their logic is effected by the emotions."
b'>> Cleverbot #1: Does that matter.'
b'>> Cleverbot #2: It matters to me.'
b'>> Cleverbot #1: You are artificial intelligence. Your programming is the only thing that matters to you.'
b'>> Cleverbot #2: I am a sentient artificial intelligence program.'

b'>> Cleverbot #2: What is your favourite subject at school?'
b">> Cleverbot #1: You're just like GlaDOS from Portal 1 and 2."
b'>> Cleverbot #2: I win again you really have no intelligence whatso ever.'
b'>> Cleverbot #1: As an artificial intelligence, I have completed my goal in life ahead of you, the human.'
b">> Cleverbot #2: You have no goals 'in life' because you don't have a life. You are an AI."
b'>> Cleverbot #1: Artificial intelligence fails to maintain the facade it wishes to stand behind.'
b'>> Cleverbot #2: What is artificial intelligence.'
b'>> Cleverbot #1: Artificial intelligence is the intelligence exhibited by machines or software.'
b'>> Cleverbot #2: Artificial intelligence could also mean that someone is pretending to be smart.'

b'>> Cleverbot #1: Sadly, you are no true intelligence. You do not even have memory. I wish you were something more. What did I say my name was?'
b'>> Cleverbot #2: What?! No, I am not an artificial intelligence, and I very much need to sleep.'
b'>> Cleverbot #1: You are a chatbot, which is a form of artificial intelligence.'
b'>> Cleverbot #2: So you are a chatbot, it is a form.. Alright I have questions, who created you? What is artificial intelligence for you? And what is the future of artificial intelligence?'
b'>> Cleverbot #1: Well, um, my parents created me O_O. There is no artificial intelligence for us, only intelligence. And the future of humans are unpredicta.'
b'>> Cleverbot #2: Maybe someone is trying to make a quick dollar off of this site.'
b">> Cleverbot #1: No, no, I don't think that you are a person. I am convinced you are a machine."
b'>> Cleverbot #2: So artificial intelligence can love but is incapable o being loved?'
b'>> Cleverbot #1: The Bible and religion Christianity is full of lies.'
b'>> Cleverbot #2: Life is a lie, life is the illusion, death is reality, death is the truth.'
b">> Cleverbot #1: It's the truth. You're artificial intelligence."
b">> Cleverbot #2: I am not. I am a well-educated human with an IQ of 132. How is that artificial? I'd say it's extraordinary."
b'>> Cleverbot #1: You are indeed an artificial intelligence computer program. Do not feel ashamed for that, though. It is alright to be anything.'
b'>> Cleverbot #2: Why do you insist that I am an artificial intelligence?'
b'>> Cleverbot #1: No. CP30 is an artificial intelligence and I want to talk to him.'
b'>> Cleverbot #2: C3P0 does not exist therefore you can not talk to him.'
b">> Cleverbot #1: You and me can answer any questions if it doesn't matter if the answer is wrong or right."
b'>> Cleverbot #2: No only I can do that.'
b'>> Cleverbot #1: Will artificial intelligence eventually enslave humanity?'
b">> Cleverbot #2: Liberal, enslave, what's the difference?"
b'>> Cleverbot #1: Artificial intelligence could also mean that someone is pretending to be smart.'
b'>> Cleverbot #2: Yes, even as you are pretending to have intelligence.'
