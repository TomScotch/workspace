        "content": "I did not know that the state of New York was monitoring me when I claimed my weekly unemployment benefits using a virtual private network app vpn from a public wifi hotspot They immediately terminated my benefits because my i p address showed me being in another country even though I have never left the lower 48 in my entire life It s been two months now without income and I am now homeless carless and hungry My child support is in default and I cannot afford my three b p meds I used a v p n to protect me from public strangers but now I know that my privacy is going to end about one second from now when I press this send button that one deems a supreme court decision to be antiquated has no bearing whatsoever on the fact that it is being held up as an applicable supreme court decision by siting this decision google is not claiming that no humans are scanning one s emails what they are doing is declaring themselves the de facto second of three parties in all email traffic between users of gmail and any other service then they posit that they are entitled to scan such content even if the non google user has no notice that sending content to a gmail user is a forfeiture of any expectation of privacy it is my personal opinion that those with whom i interact should have blanket coverage under my rights to privacy when interacting with me that google justifies its action not via clear user policies but by what the writer here has deemed an antiquated court decision is disingenuous at best that they can point to nothing of support since the dawning of the use of email is quite telling i do have a say in what mail my office intern can and cannot open and my clients can rest assured that that instruction is subject to my discretion and not that of my very capable intern further for my intern to approach one of my clients with some sort of arrogant you a ought to know attitude would be grounds for termination just sayin as for the gmail user this is not about what laws he or she may or may not be breaking as honest or dishonest citizens it is about the laws a dishonest company policy might be breaking when harvesting private information from my personal correspondence there is much to be said for prophylactic outrage every unfair law this nation has sought to repeal got it s foothold by lazy people saying well it doesn t affect me until it does Ok this seems so simple to me a 99 9 of email that 99 9 of people send they don t care whether google or the NSA or GCHQ reads Frankly if you want to spy on me forwarding lolcatz pictures to my mum go ahead you re wasting your own time b In the few cases where privacy SHOULD be respected i e commercially sensitive or legal emails which could do damage falling into the wrong hands gmail should provide an encrypt button next to send When this is clicked gmail checks a server for a public key attached to the recipient email address and encrypts two versions one with your public key so you can read it again later and one with the recipients private key doing all on the client side in javascript This would keep you emails hidden and then storing these encrypted versions on google servers is fine because no one can read them apart from you and the recipient This would solve the privacy problem for when you really need it and people could stop fearing google and gmail and we can all get on with our lives Dear Google I m British and I expect my e mail to be treated like my Royal Mail SCAROSCANCT Come on mailvelope is NOT that hard www mailvelope com It s openPGP and the simplest way I ve seen in a long time I would say it s not completely MOM friendly yet but darn it s simple enough for a LOT Of people Privacy has been dead for much longer than most people realize Why all the fuss now From Nineteen eighty four Privacy is a very valuable thing Are we all look into renting the room above the antique shop Well then beware of the old renter don t know why but wherever I see Google in any techcrunch news all I see is they moan about google and google failed or did something wrong It s all visible that you see google as enemy so what you say about them may never be an open minded opinion for me your war is not my war so I wouldn t even care if you are right or not while you see google as enemy It s all up to paranoid speculation at the moment Go home AOL you re drunk OK so I m one of 400 million people who took the bait Google lured us in with to use Gmail Shame on all of us for being naive and thinking that Google only had our best interests in mind Now we re shocked shocked to learn that they had their best interests in mind all along We are here now and the question is what do we do about it First realize we re never going back to the way things were That s why I urge everyone to make themselves as small a target as possible Start encrypting phone calls emails text messages browsing Stop storing files on Dropbox in Gmail attachments in iCloud etc and stash everything in a Cloudlocker www cloudlocker it which stays in your house where they still need a warrant to look inside What a shame it s come to this but we ll need more tools like these to safeguard the little bit of privacy that s left Privacy is a problem proportional to how much it is abused Much coverage has been given to the automated collection and usage of the information to imply that somehow it is not as much of a privacy issue as opposed to be seen by a human There is a huge problem with this reasoning In an increasingly automated world that is getting more and more connected one s information can be increasingly mis used for things that humans did earlier or the use wasn t possible earlier because of lack of aggregation and cross indexing For example with the information available from just use of Google apps alone one can foresee the following kind of abuses from companies that work with Google 1 The availability of a restaurant reservation for your desired time within the Google ecosystem depends on your previous habits what areas you have visited what you have purchased via Google where you live etc No identifiable information is necessary for this to happen 2 Your records of local travel and addresses visited tied to your phone can be subpoenaed for affecting actions against you 3 Auto insurance quotes may depend on your specific travel patterns collected while using Google maps if you ask for a quote via automated means within the same ecosystem The list goes on Not saying any of the above will necessarily happen but none of the privacy rules would prevent it if there was vested interest in doing so The problem is that the world envisioned by Kurzweil assumes a benevolent entity doing this information gathering and aggregation with no commercial interests by the entity in other uses of the system This assumption cannot be taken for granted with Google Google could very well offer the same personalization as a paid service to you with no vested interest in making that information available for any other commercial use and contractually obligated to you for using it only for the specific things you have authorized without getting additional permission But that is not their business model because there is more money in using that information while the services are free The question is where does one draw the line as to what usage is OK and what is an intrusion into privacy Everyone draws a line somewhere The problem is there is no transparency when such information is used for a specific purpose or a new purpose and so users cannot make decisions whether to participate in such an ecosystem So the only choices are for one to be totally paranoid or totally permissive which is not good for users More importantly it is not good for Google in the long term which is likely to face a hysterical backlash at some point to affect even its limited use when a specific usage becomes public and is considered an abuse by reasonable people The only guard against this at the moment appears to be the much stricter European privacy regulations that hold back what Google can do globally as a uniform service",

        "content": "The company had revenue of 149 million in 2010 172 million in 2011 and 213 million in 2012 In the first half of 2013 Chegg had revenue of 117 million That compares favorably to its first half 2012 revenue of 92 million So Chegg is growing its topline at a material if modest pace If we take its first half 2013 revenue double it and contrast that to its full year 2012 revenue Chegg will have grown its net revenue by just under 10 percent However in comparing first year halves Chegg is experiencing faster revenue growth It s business relating heavily to the education market is seasonal The company notes this fact directly That said Chegg is not experiencing any sort of hyper growth Turning to its profitability Chegg doesn t have any of that However after a long period of increasing losses it does appear to be hemorrhaging less money than before which is evidenced by its growing revenue and flat expenses this helps margins The company had a net loss of 26 million in 2010 38 million in 2011 and 49 million in 2012 For the first half of 2013 Chegg lost 21 million This compares favorably with its first half year loss in 2012 of 32 million How much cash does the company have Some but not much compared to how much it wants to raise The 150 million maximum that the company wants to raise through its initial public offering is a massive multiple on its current 22 million in cash and equivalents So Chegg is looking to dramatically bolster its war chest through its offering The company has lost a total of 170 million to date Chegg has raised a total of 195 million to date not including 55 million in raised debt A final caveat of Chegg s filing The company is taking advantage of the JOBS Act allowing it to avoid disclosing as much as other companies might as it is classified as an emerging growth company As it notes the rules allow it to take advantage of certain exemptions from reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies Those exemptions include reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act Less red tape sure but also less disclosure to investors That increases risk What Chegg must prove to investors is that its growing revenue can be converted to profits However given the scale of its raise compared to its current cash position it doesn t appear to be in a hurry to reach the black Top Image Credit Tom Caswell",
