        "content": "Whether it be a fine Night Train vintage or a delectable bag of Boone s Drync allows you to scan the label of nearly any grand cru and bring up a detailed listing of the vintage varietal and brand It also allows you to order the wine right from your cellphone ensuring the party doesn t stop even three to five business days after it began To reach their goal of bringing a robotic sommelier to every phone the company has raised 900 000 from angel investors including Mark Hastings Andrew Moss and Jack Remondi The founders Bill Kirtley and Brad Rosen are entrepreneurs with years of app experience in their wineskins Rosen built and sold companies to Phillips Motorola and Cisco among others and Kirtley worked at Apple on the Safari and Calendar products How does Drync work Think of it as Shazam for booze Once you scan the bottle the system reads the label and tries to match it in its 1 7 million bottle database You can then order the wine right through the app Considering most other wine apps focus on collection of labels for later perusal Drync is a godsend We are focused on mobile wine commerce enabling people to buy the wines they like at the moment they try them with their iPhone We think of it as a Shazam or SoundHound for wine Other players in the space create social networks for wine give people ways to log the wines they drink offer wine pairings or provide generic or limited selections of wines to order online said Rosen To test the app I pulled out a few bottles of fine tipple to scan and or drink at 9am My initial tests didn t look very promising I scanned a Ravenswood Chardonnay non vintage 9 99 at Kroger and Drync brought up everything except the chard However some of the team began scanning other wines they had lying around their hovels and got far better results For example our own Romain Dillet was able to identify a fine French bouteille without issue Rosen explained that many of Ravenswood labels are nearly exactly the same and that they ve gotten to about 80 correct in their scanning process Even if it doesn t scan in the proper bottle however you can always consult the image it took to update the database and help the system return the proper vino next time I especially liked the checkout system which allowed you to scan your credit card and have it shipped to your house in a few clicks We at Drync are the first to connect the experiential part of drinking wine with the purchase using your phone to capture and purchase nearly any wine instantly at the point of consumption said Rosen Just as we don t all have the same taste in food the idea of a wine being good is largely subjective With Drync you can buy based on your taste Rosen and the team have been working on the app for years starting in 2008 when it was a simple wine scanner Now however by adding a bit of cash and a lot of back end smarts they have an app that true connoisseurs can use and love It s an enormous market with a lot of potential We ve been brewing this platform and model for 5 years and are really excited about our positioning said Rosen So next time you end up in a culvert howling away at the filthy songs of your fathers and going blurp blurp in between as it might be a filthy old orchestra in your stinking rotten guts remember to pull out your iPhone for a bit of the old Drync You ll most probably be glad you did if you remember in the morning",

        "content": "On June 27 of this year shares closed at 393 78 roughly back to their December 2011 level Today s price represents a 27 8 percent increase in just 48 days The last time shares were trading above 500 was on January 23 It proves once again that AAPL still suffers from a lot of volatility and uncertainty Even though net profit is still declining Apple reported good numbers for its Q3 2013 fiscal quarter After multiple mixed quarters the company managed to beat the analysts expectations Retrospectively the market reaction to Q1 and Q2 numbers was certainly too harsh when you compare it to the actual numbers Apple still has more than 145 billion in cash and a comfortable market position iPhone sales are still growing 20 percent year over year Moreover Apple started a huge 100 billion share buyback program last year and investors are starting to see the effects As a result earnings per share has mechanically increased over time Investor Carl Icahn revealed yesterday that he was lobbying to accelerate the share buyback program It drove the stock up 4 percent in just minutes proving that investors are confident that Apple shares are a good component in their portfolios When it comes to products back in April Apple s growth prospects were gloomy the magical period of double digit growth for both sales and profit was over Yet the analysts expectations led to distortion For years they were setting the bar too high for units and market share and too low for profit and sales Now that analysts are more accurate the perception of Apple is changing at the same time While the company didn t release any new product after WWDC aside from the updated MacBook Air the keynote was received very well by commentators The star of the show was iOS 7 It proved that Apple was still ready to make radical changes to its core products without fearing backlash In other words Apple is still innovating But customers are now more likely than ever to buy old iPhone models Apple needs to contract the production costs of old models or to find an alternative In addition to releasing a new flagship iPhone it will probably release a new low cost iPhone probably the iPhone 5C As the company is now switching to another product strategy with the iPhone 5C right around the corner it will become easier to understand Apple numbers in the coming months Similarly to the iPad mini Apple now wants to capture another segment of the smartphone market with a low cost iPhone and to stay dominant when it comes to profit As a consequence the company could fight back in the market share war with Android It would give a great perception boost to Apple More importantly investors are already taking into account the upcoming iPhone event On September 19 of 2012 shares peaked at 702 10 following a very strong summer This year the stock is experiencing the exact same scenario and it will be interesting to see the trend following the new iPhone releases",
