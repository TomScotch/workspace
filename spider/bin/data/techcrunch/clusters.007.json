        "content": "Mike19 You probably work for Chegg or have a family member that does which is why you re defending them I don t care either way what happens to Chegg as I m an objective observer Do you honestly believe that sales of digital textbooks won t increasingly eat into the revenues from sales of physical textbooks in the next 5 10 years Chegg can and does sell rent digital textbooks but they have to compete with lots of other much larger companies in that area such as Amazon Apple Google etc who have much larger marketing budgets and access to many more people to sell to As physical textbooks are phased out Chegg will lose more and more of it s market share This is definitely not a stock to hold onto LG123 True I don t think their business model can ever become profitable at least when it comes to renting physical textbooks They might purchase a new edition physical textbook for 100 and rent it out for 25 a semester Not taking into account costs of warehouse labor it will take them at least 4 semesters to make back the money they initially spent on that textbook by which point a new edition might have been released by the publisher making the old edition command less in rental prices because students would be able to purchase the old edition outright for about the same price and be able to keep it forever if they wished to do so The only way that they can continue to attract students to their rentals is by offering steep discounts but that strategy will just cause them to continue to burn through investor money andy4 Exactly They know that the future is digital textbooks so their market dominance in renting physical textbooks won t matter 5 years down the road since Apple Amazon Google and lots of other companies will be competing with them to sell or rent digital textbooks This move to IPO seems like a plan by investors to cash out before it s too late Anyone left holding Chegg stock in a few years will be screwed",
