        "content": "The company had revenue of 149 million in 2010 172 million in 2011 and 213 million in 2012 In the first half of 2013 Chegg had revenue of 117 million That compares favorably to its first half 2012 revenue of 92 million So Chegg is growing its topline at a material if modest pace If we take its first half 2013 revenue double it and contrast that to its full year 2012 revenue Chegg will have grown its net revenue by just under 10 percent However in comparing first year halves Chegg is experiencing faster revenue growth It s business relating heavily to the education market is seasonal The company notes this fact directly That said Chegg is not experiencing any sort of hyper growth Turning to its profitability Chegg doesn t have any of that However after a long period of increasing losses it does appear to be hemorrhaging less money than before which is evidenced by its growing revenue and flat expenses this helps margins The company had a net loss of 26 million in 2010 38 million in 2011 and 49 million in 2012 For the first half of 2013 Chegg lost 21 million This compares favorably with its first half year loss in 2012 of 32 million How much cash does the company have Some but not much compared to how much it wants to raise The 150 million maximum that the company wants to raise through its initial public offering is a massive multiple on its current 22 million in cash and equivalents So Chegg is looking to dramatically bolster its war chest through its offering The company has lost a total of 170 million to date Chegg has raised a total of 195 million to date not including 55 million in raised debt A final caveat of Chegg s filing The company is taking advantage of the JOBS Act allowing it to avoid disclosing as much as other companies might as it is classified as an emerging growth company As it notes the rules allow it to take advantage of certain exemptions from reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies Those exemptions include reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act Less red tape sure but also less disclosure to investors That increases risk What Chegg must prove to investors is that its growing revenue can be converted to profits However given the scale of its raise compared to its current cash position it doesn t appear to be in a hurry to reach the black Top Image Credit Tom Caswell",
