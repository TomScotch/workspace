        "content": "If we had the technology to rewire our brains to help remember certain things and forget others it could help millions of people struggling with neurological conditions from Alzheimer s to post traumatic stress disorder But it also raises the frightening possibility depicted over and over again in sci fi that someone would be able to use such technology to mess with people s minds without their consent For good or ill such techniques are edging closer to reality In the last few months several teams of scientists have made enormous leaps in visualizing memories and manipulating them The work is confined to animals for now but helping adjust the functioning of the human brain is the ultimate goal raising the questions just how far can and should we go In June a team of scientists led by researchers at the University of Southern California published a paper explaining that they had figured out a way to watch memories form in the brains of mice and zebrafish in real time The paper was largely overlooked by the mainstream press at the time but its implications for the future of neurobiology are enormous This provides a much clearer window into the brain than anyone s ever had before it s hard to predict where this will go from here says Donald Arnold an associate professor of molecular and computational biology at the University of Southern California who led the team Using this technique it should be possible to use this to delete and modify memory in some way he explains Microscopic image of a neuron in the brain of a living mouse showing synapses lit up with fluorescent probes Credit Donald Arnold University of Southern California Prior to the work by Arnold and his colleagues scientists weren t exactly sure how memories were encoded in the brain The basic consensus was that whenever you experience something your memory is stored in neurons specialized tree branch like nerve cells that number in the tens of billions in a single human brain and which carry information in the form of electrical signals Neurons communicate with one another across gaps known as synapses When an electrical signal carrying information say a memory reaches the end of a neuron it triggers the release of a chemical called a neurotransmitter which then floats across the synapse and lands on the receiving end of another neuron Think of pollen floating from one tree to another If all goes correctly the receiving neuron picks up the neurotransmitter and fires its own electrical signal which may cause it to release a neurotransmitter to yet another neuron It s this passage of information between neurons that lets your brain function The vividness of a particular memory is thought to be related to the strength of synapses that is how reliably the neuron fires when it picks up a neurotransmitter But scientists haven t been able to see this process of memory encoding in action until now What Arnold and his colleagues did was create a protein that sticks to the portion of a neuron responsible for absorbing the neurotransmitter called the receptor Then they took a green fluorescent protein from jellyfish and stuck that onto the other end of their protein When they implanted their glowing proteins into mice and zebrafish brains they were able to look through a fluorescence microscope and watch as their proteins collected around the receptors Microscopic image of the dendrite or electrically conductive branchlike ends of a neuron in a mouse with glowing proteins showing synaptic strength Credit Donald Arnold University of Southern California This allows us not only to see where synapses are but how strong they are by how bright and big these dots are Arnold tells The Verge We can see new synapses forming and old synapses disappearing and changes in synaptic strength Arnold says that his team s next work would involve teaching zebrafish and mice particular tasks and watching to see how their synapses change Ultimately the experiment we envision is looking at a mouse having the mouse learn something seeing how the synapses change then going back in there and modifying the synapses to see if you can get rid of the memory Arnold says Deleting a memory using this technique would involve simply sticking a natural protein made in the brain on to the same protein made by researchers which carries the glowing material It s like a guided missile you can put whatever payload you want on it Arnold says But as he says deleting memories in people using this method seems way far off to me Instead he says it would be easier to screen for drugs that would help you forget Already his team has begun work on arming the proteins they ve made to help delete some other proteins such as those that build up in the brains of those suffering neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson s and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS It s known that the vast majority of proteins in the brain turn over every week or faster Arnold says A week from now your brain is essentially built from entirely new proteins Nobody knows how that happens and your memories are retained It s crazy But in neurodegenerative diseases certain proteins that would ordinarily disappear linger and build up in brain cells causing memory problems A bit of this trash doesn t seem to get picked up it just builds and builds Arnold explains Can you get rid of the junk that builds up Why does it build up We want to at least start to answer these questions Other scientists are taking a different approaching to understanding how the brain stores and transmits information coming at it from other body parts connected to an animal s nervous system For instance a team of researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research in Germany reported earlier this week that they d successfully mapped 950 neurons in a slice of retina from a dead mouse s eye This technique could have applications for restoring sight and if applied to the brain for manipulating memory Diagram of neurons in a slice of mouse retina Credit Fabian Isensee Julia Kuhl Helmstaedter et all We can imagine that our wiring diagram of the retina can help scientists down the road design and target retinal prosthetics to the right neurons says Srinivas Turaga one of the MIT scientists involved in an email to The Verge And like you suggest with memory manipulation having a circuit diagram will tell us which neurons to manipulate and how Turaga and his colleagues created their map of the mouse retina by using an electron microscope to take 3D images of the slice of retina then having no less than 225 undergraduate students look at the images and physically trace the wiring connecting them by hand which took a collective 20 000 hours He tells The Verge that his German colleagues were working on additional microscopic technology that would be able to image larger slices and that we hope that this will eventually allow us to scan a mouse brain in about a year Turuga says that tracing all those neurons could take up to another 5 to 10 years total Still when the researchers achieve that goal they also hope to use their advances to help treat those suffering from neurological diseases Having this wiring diagram or connectome will allow us to better understand what a normal neural circuit looks like and to detect and shed light on abnormalities in the circuitry associated with neurological disorders Turaga says Once we can better understand such circuit abnormalities or connectopathies we can develop targeted methods of treatment Although some groups of scientists are getting closer to figuring out just how the brain works to store information others have already begun tinkering with memories Last week a team of scientists led by a different group at MIT made headlines around the world for their success at implanting a false memory into mouse subjects getting the mice to think that they had been painfully shocked in one location when in reality they d been shocked in an entirely different one The scientists achieved this by stimulating specific neurons in one area of the mouse brains Diagram showing light stimulation of a mouse neuron in order to implant a false memory Credit Science Magazine MIT One of the scientists involved in that MIT project neurobiologist Steve Ramirez later told The New York Times that he thought it would soon be possible to use similar techniques to delete specific parts of memories Rather than wiping out the whole memory of a relationship and an ex girlfriend as in the 2004 sci fi romantic comedy movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Ramirez says we can get rid of the sad part of that memory only Indeed humans have fantasized about being able to reprogram our minds at will since the early days of written history In ancient Greek mythology the souls of the dead were supposed to drink from a river of forgetfulness in the underworld in order to forget their lives and be reincarnated Aside from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind many other stories and movies have tackled the subject of memory manipulation from Total Recall to Inception to Dark City But some scientists think that even given all these recent advances humans won t and shouldn t ever get to the point where the scenarios described in sci fi are possible Those memory altering techniques are invasive using either genetic engineering or virus methods to manipulate genes in the mouse brain comments Joe Tsien a neurology professor who serves as co director of Georgia Regents University s Brain and Behavior Discovery Institute Tsien would know given that back in 2008 he and his colleagues successfully deleted specific memories in mice by targeting yet another type of brain protein Going forward Tsien says It is unlikely these experimental techniques in mice can be directly transferred for use in wiping a human person s memories He points out that memories of upsetting or traumatic events are actually crucial to our evolution teaching us resilience and to avoid certain situations or behaviors that may lead to hardship Removing them might make a person feel better but would also doom them to repeat their mistakes Memories whether good or bad serve an adaptive purpose Tsien says",

        "content": "Long after Apple s victory over Samsung in a patent suit the two companies met again today in court as a panel of judges decides whether to issue a sales ban on over two dozen Samsung devices These phones and tablets were found to use features and designs patented by Apple but so far that decision has only resulted in a major fine for Samsung in December Judge Lucy Koh found that damages were enough for Apple to recoup its losses so an out and out ban wasn t warranted Now Apple has brought its case to the Federal Court of Appeals which is set to make what could be a near final call on the issue Apple s requested ban doesn t mean much in the short term Of the 26 phones and tablets it listed 23 have been discontinued and Samsung has worked to design around Apple s patents in the remaining three Samsung meanwhile says the ban would have little impact on its design process So why does this case matter on either side For its part Apple hopes that getting an injunction will make it easier to bring cases against newer products Taking a quick dig at Samsung s design process Apple attorney William Lee said that a new Samsung device might be almost identical to an old banned one What they re saying to you is the product with this name is off the market he said If it gets the ban Apple would still need to bring more cases but it could have an easier time in court This would hurt Samsung obviously but it s not the company s only fear Any injunction it says would hurt its relationship with retail stores and carriers who would worry about whether they were accidentally selling an infringing product Likewise this could have a major impact on the second ongoing Apple vs Samsung case which should go to trial early next year Though it decisively won the original case Apple is on the defensive here Koh decided Apple hadn t proved its patents were a driving factor in how customers chose phones For Apple to get its injunction it first has to convince the court that this bar was set far too high then make a case for why it meets a different lower standard I don t think that anybody in Apple s position could absolutely prove a major link between a single feature or collection of features and sales said Lee Companies can be required to prove irreparable harm but holding Apple to this standard would be a fundamental change in American patent law he argued But Samsung has steadily claimed that the patents in question weren t major factors when buying a phone There s no proof of any infringement here being a driver much less the driver of consumer demand said Samsung lawyer Kathleen Sullivan During the case Apple presented a report showing how much customers would pay for the extra UI features Samsung copied on phones an extra 100 Sullivan questioned whether the survey itself was relevant an argument that seemed to hold little water with the judges She used the example of one car company copying another s cupholders The fact that I d pay 10 more for a car that I was going to buy anyways doesn t show that it s driving consumer demand she said It still doesn t tell you that the phone with the infringing feature will be chosen over the non infringing product she said Judge William Bryson disagreed It shows that consumers value that feature he said That seems to me to be the very essence of what a driver of demand is He then moved the question from cupholders to something like a hybrid engine which he said could be an important feature even if customers still decided on a cheaper non hybrid one It wouldn t be too surprising to see Koh s earlier decision overturned she and the appeals court have frequently disagreed on when to ban a product Early in the case the court decided she was wrong to let Samsung keep selling devices that arguably infringed on Apple s design Later though it overturned her ban on the Galaxy Nexus saying Apple hadn t proven its universal search was a major sales driver In this case the court won t be deciding whether to temporarily ban something before deciding whether it s infringing it will be making a call after a jury overwhelmingly decided that Samsung did in fact copy Apple And though Samsung s lawyer denied it the judges repeatedly asked whether she was arguing against bans for entire broad classes of lawsuits which would back up Apple s claim of a fundamental change in the law Depending on how convincing the court finds Apple s argument it could either completely uphold Koh s decision or throw it out at which point either company could potentially appeal to the Supreme Court Conversely it could hand the issue back to Koh giving her instructions to consider it further or issue specific injunctions Closure has been slow in coming with this lawsuit but today s hearing marked a step towards the end of at least one part of it",
