until he has one too many drinks and then he gets kind of creepy Before The Awl he was an editor at Gawker twice as well at The New York Observer He is also the author of Very Recent History An Entirely Factual Account of a Year c AD 2009 in a Large City available today and published by Harper I conducted an interview with Choire on Google Docs We never once took it to phone So you have written a book Is it fiction or nonfiction I read it and I m not sure Does it matter if it s fiction or non fiction This has been a really wacko cool experience that people are like Hey what the hell is this book Usually that s expressed as some complicated emoji sentence often combining the triangular poop icon with that weird one of someone in the bathtub and sometimes the gun So I think that it matters very much to me and it matters to librarians and it might matter to the people in the book who are all very real and delightful but it won t matter at all to most readers That s totally cool I mean hey You do you LOL gross sorry For the certain kind of reader who does care I am here to verify that the book is 100 percent true Every person every fact every piece of dialogue all of it Any errors of fact are mine obviously And carefully true for instance right away I declare that for a while the richest person in the city is the mayor This is true but it really was for a brief time and it was only as near as anyone could calculate It s hard to figure out who s richer than whom But definitely everyone agrees that a while back now Ol Mayor Mike got outgunned as richest bro in town Did you enjoy writing it Was it the worst How did you do it did you set aside specific chunks of time or just fit it in when the mood struck Well publishing a book the part when it goes out in the world is even worse It s kind of like when you think you re having a deep private session on Spotify and then you realize NOPE everyone can see you listening to Mariah Carey remixes Actually it s like being one of those people who put a photo up on eBay of some stupid furniture and then everyone figures out they can see you in some reflection and you re REALLY NAKED AND NOT PRETTY But yeah Writing a book basically eats a bag of dog balls You just gotta write all the time That s the secret Great fucking secret right STUPID SECRET But I firmly believe that anyone who wants to can and should do it You could be done with a book before Christmas It s actually not brain surgery because no one really agrees what a good book is so maybe even though you have no idea what you re doing it s possible everyone will be like Hey this is awesome I mean I didn t go to college I barely graduated high school and no one taught me how to write properly and then a Rupert Murdoch company gave me a decent pile of money to write a book and actually published it even though it was clearly a piece of craziness So it could happen to anyone Go for it You re probably better off learning how to trade securities though so consider that The book seems very personal in that I get the sense there are a lot of people who will read it and recognize themselves or others in it So are you now panicking asking yourself What have I done Or are you at peace with it You mean like emotionally recognize No that s good That s supposed to happen Or if you mean like IRL recognize well the number of people who d be like Oh is this person that friend of that guy is pretty vanishingly small in the world The reason the book s characters are anonymous is because we didn t think it was fair to their Google record honestly Books are short because they re between two covers but Google is forever One thing that s cool to me about the book is people talking about technology actually There s a weird long monologue by this guy who s convinced that growing up with Gchat kind of ruined him that he s so much better in chat than he is IRL I might be better in chat than I am in real life too And there s whole comedies of errors about how to communicate with people when you re simultaneously using text message Facebook and hookup sites There s Grindr there s Missed Connections Also the semi modern agony of being nonconsensually blogged about That s the worst thing Especially since you also run The Awl After editing and writing at for other places what made you want to run your OWN website Do you find it easier to work for yourself It seems like in a lot of ways it would be far far more stressful Well I could never do it without a business partner I still need someone to be accountable to Fortunately we both have the same high level of Oh all these plans went to shit FUCK IT LET S GO TO LUNCH The thing that 2008 and 2009 convinced me of and really that s what the book is about is that no employer will ever give a fuck about me Or really about most anyone Like it s all good until the funding dries up or the grants dry up or until a recession comes or until some stupid asshole rich person has a whim and decides to close up shop Then you re out on your ass and what about your commitments to your friends spouses children parents cats rents and stomachs But the money people don t care They don t have to care That s not in the agreements of how we work So fine That s not an agreement I want to have either then I think I m ruined with working for other people now Uh we ll see how that works out The fun thing about being an independently owned non investment backed company is that you have to stay profitable or it s CURTAINS for you Really more people should operate like that It s good for the soul In running an independent website what is the best part The writing editing the designing selling ads It seems like you re probably involved in all aspects of it so What is the best part and what is the worst I think we kind of love almost all of it really The good joke answer is I love delegating Which I do honestly But I particularly love editing most of the time I do hate that because we re so lean it can take a really long time to get things done that we really care about Making new sites takes forever I get jealous sometimes of people with all that borrowed cash But I don t get jealous for long Pretty much all of my least favorite things involve let s take it to phone Fuck phones People who take it to the phone Back to books for a second What is your favorite Do you have one I hate this question but it s so fun to ask My three favorite books are probably The Dispossessed Reckless Disregard Westmoreland v CBS et al Sharon v Time and hmm right now Iphigenia in Forest Hills That one s still sitting with me pretty hard Although I could probably also say My 10 favorite books are these 10 Ursula Le Guin books in this particular order What level are you on in Candy Crush Will have follow up based on your answer Oh shit Low blow Okay I am on level 272 The sad thing about this is not that I am on level 272 though that is sad but that it has disrupted my love affair with Robot Wants Kitty Do you play Robot Wants Kitty The genius of the app is that they rolled out a Kitty Connect level builder a while back and there are tons of people building games in this world And many of them are geniuses There was this guy named Fomb who built the best game levels of any game I ve ever seen And then a couple months ago now he retired I wonder what he s putting all his energy into now He s a really remarkable thinker I realize that s a big thing to say about someone who builds platform game levels If Candy Crush had existed when you were writing the book would you have finished it yet I think procrastination is good for us My writing process is Turn on loud music type for a while take a smoke break write a little while watch 30 minutes of TV write for two minutes take a shower jump out of the shower and write down some notes watch some more TV write for awhile The point being the back of our animal brain does things while we are doing other stupider things It s important Candy Crush is magical brain shut down time What kind of phone do you have Also what are the apps on your homescreen and why Like every loser I have an iPhone You know I could make the switch for the right non Apple product I go out and touch one every now and again I guess I m just scared Fine here is my homescreen This is a weird self doxx Um I never update my apps answer my phone open my Snapchats or check GroupMe or Vine so why do I have a phone anyway Actually I use it for notes for writing and for recording interviews so that s useful And cat pictures When you wake up I assume it s very early what are the first three things you read This terrible new thing happens where because I sleep with my phone under my pillow I just wake up at dawn and then turn on my phone and start wherever I stopped So this means that I often fall asleep and I reawake with half written emails or like unsent tweets that are like asdfhhjjjjjjjjjjj because I fell asleep writing them This is no way to live The upside is that the first thing I read is some random links that some English person tweeted because they re the only ones awake I saw a tweet of yours the other day of

ARE IN LOVE The car thing comes from our last cat Cat The Cat RIP When he was about 18 years old we moved down to Miami for a little while and he spent his last year there I was back in New York a lot for work and when I was away my husband used to drive him around at night He was this scrawny old beast but he d stand up on his hind legs with his front feet on the dashboard and stare out the window or stand on my husband s lap while he drove Cats love cars So yeah We drive cats around a lot Looks around awkwardly The Awl endorsed Eliot Spitzer for governor of NY in a recent editorial written by

        "content": "If we had the technology to rewire our brains to help remember certain things and forget others it could help millions of people struggling with neurological conditions from Alzheimer s to post traumatic stress disorder But it also raises the frightening possibility depicted over and over again in sci fi that someone would be able to use such technology to mess with people s minds without their consent For good or ill such techniques are edging closer to reality In the last few months several teams of scientists have made enormous leaps in visualizing memories and manipulating them The work is confined to animals for now but helping adjust the functioning of the human brain is the ultimate goal raising the questions just how far can and should we go In June a team of scientists led by researchers at the University of Southern California published a paper explaining that they had figured out a way to watch memories form in the brains of mice and zebrafish in real time The paper was largely overlooked by the mainstream press at the time but its implications for the future of neurobiology are enormous This provides a much clearer window into the brain than anyone s ever had before it s hard to predict where this will go from here says Donald Arnold an associate professor of molecular and computational biology at the University of Southern California who led the team Using this technique it should be possible to use this to delete and modify memory in some way he explains Microscopic image of a neuron in the brain of a living mouse showing synapses lit up with fluorescent probes Credit Donald Arnold University of Southern California Prior to the work by Arnold and his colleagues scientists weren t exactly sure how memories were encoded in the brain The basic consensus was that whenever you experience something your memory is stored in neurons specialized tree branch like nerve cells that number in the tens of billions in a single human brain and which carry information in the form of electrical signals Neurons communicate with one another across gaps known as synapses When an electrical signal carrying information say a memory reaches the end of a neuron it triggers the release of a chemical called a neurotransmitter which then floats across the synapse and lands on the receiving end of another neuron Think of pollen floating from one tree to another If all goes correctly the receiving neuron picks up the neurotransmitter and fires its own electrical signal which may cause it to release a neurotransmitter to yet another neuron It s this passage of information between neurons that lets your brain function The vividness of a particular memory is thought to be related to the strength of synapses that is how reliably the neuron fires when it picks up a neurotransmitter But scientists haven t been able to see this process of memory encoding in action until now What Arnold and his colleagues did was create a protein that sticks to the portion of a neuron responsible for absorbing the neurotransmitter called the receptor Then they took a green fluorescent protein from jellyfish and stuck that onto the other end of their protein When they implanted their glowing proteins into mice and zebrafish brains they were able to look through a fluorescence microscope and watch as their proteins collected around the receptors Microscopic image of the dendrite or electrically conductive branchlike ends of a neuron in a mouse with glowing proteins showing synaptic strength Credit Donald Arnold University of Southern California This allows us not only to see where synapses are but how strong they are by how bright and big these dots are Arnold tells The Verge We can see new synapses forming and old synapses disappearing and changes in synaptic strength Arnold says that his team s next work would involve teaching zebrafish and mice particular tasks and watching to see how their synapses change Ultimately the experiment we envision is looking at a mouse having the mouse learn something seeing how the synapses change then going back in there and modifying the synapses to see if you can get rid of the memory Arnold says Deleting a memory using this technique would involve simply sticking a natural protein made in the brain on to the same protein made by researchers which carries the glowing material It s like a guided missile you can put whatever payload you want on it Arnold says But as he says deleting memories in people using this method seems way far off to me Instead he says it would be easier to screen for drugs that would help you forget Already his team has begun work on arming the proteins they ve made to help delete some other proteins such as those that build up in the brains of those suffering neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson s and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS It s known that the vast majority of proteins in the brain turn over every week or faster Arnold says A week from now your brain is essentially built from entirely new proteins Nobody knows how that happens and your memories are retained It s crazy But in neurodegenerative diseases certain proteins that would ordinarily disappear linger and build up in brain cells causing memory problems A bit of this trash doesn t seem to get picked up it just builds and builds Arnold explains Can you get rid of the junk that builds up Why does it build up We want to at least start to answer these questions Other scientists are taking a different approaching to understanding how the brain stores and transmits information coming at it from other body parts connected to an animal s nervous system For instance a team of researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research in Germany reported earlier this week that they d successfully mapped 950 neurons in a slice of retina from a dead mouse s eye This technique could have applications for restoring sight and if applied to the brain for manipulating memory Diagram of neurons in a slice of mouse retina Credit Fabian Isensee Julia Kuhl Helmstaedter et all We can imagine that our wiring diagram of the retina can help scientists down the road design and target retinal prosthetics to the right neurons says Srinivas Turaga one of the MIT scientists involved in an email to The Verge And like you suggest with memory manipulation having a circuit diagram will tell us which neurons to manipulate and how Turaga and his colleagues created their map of the mouse retina by using an electron microscope to take 3D images of the slice of retina then having no less than 225 undergraduate students look at the images and physically trace the wiring connecting them by hand which took a collective 20 000 hours He tells The Verge that his German colleagues were working on additional microscopic technology that would be able to image larger slices and that we hope that this will eventually allow us to scan a mouse brain in about a year Turuga says that tracing all those neurons could take up to another 5 to 10 years total Still when the researchers achieve that goal they also hope to use their advances to help treat those suffering from neurological diseases Having this wiring diagram or connectome will allow us to better understand what a normal neural circuit looks like and to detect and shed light on abnormalities in the circuitry associated with neurological disorders Turaga says Once we can better understand such circuit abnormalities or connectopathies we can develop targeted methods of treatment Although some groups of scientists are getting closer to figuring out just how the brain works to store information others have already begun tinkering with memories Last week a team of scientists led by a different group at MIT made headlines around the world for their success at implanting a false memory into mouse subjects getting the mice to think that they had been painfully shocked in one location when in reality they d been shocked in an entirely different one The scientists achieved this by stimulating specific neurons in one area of the mouse brains Diagram showing light stimulation of a mouse neuron in order to implant a false memory Credit Science Magazine MIT One of the scientists involved in that MIT project neurobiologist Steve Ramirez later told The New York Times that he thought it would soon be possible to use similar techniques to delete specific parts of memories Rather than wiping out the whole memory of a relationship and an ex girlfriend as in the 2004 sci fi romantic comedy movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Ramirez says we can get rid of the sad part of that memory only Indeed humans have fantasized about being able to reprogram our minds at will since the early days of written history In ancient Greek mythology the souls of the dead were supposed to drink from a river of forgetfulness in the underworld in order to forget their lives and be reincarnated Aside from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind many other stories and movies have tackled the subject of memory manipulation from Total Recall to Inception to Dark City But some scientists think that even given all these recent advances humans won t and shouldn t ever get to the point where the scenarios described in sci fi are possible Those memory altering techniques are invasive using either genetic engineering or virus methods to manipulate genes in the mouse brain comments Joe Tsien a neurology professor who serves as co director of Georgia Regents University s Brain and Behavior Discovery Institute Tsien would know given that back in 2008 he and his colleagues successfully deleted specific memories in mice by targeting yet another type of brain protein Going forward Tsien says It is unlikely these experimental techniques in mice can be directly transferred for use in wiping a human person s memories He points out that memories of upsetting or traumatic events are actually crucial to our evolution teaching us resilience and to avoid certain situations or behaviors that may lead to hardship Removing them might make a person feel better but would also doom them to repeat their mistakes Memories whether good or bad serve an adaptive purpose Tsien says",

        "content": "Microsoft had originally planned to let Xbox One users share any games digitally but a backlash over the used games policies and online check forced the company to reverse most of its promising plans Although disc based games can no longer be converted into digitally shareable copies Microsoft is outlining what can be shared this week and it s very similar to how the Xbox 360 works today The reversal of policies may have changed Microsoft s plans but Xbox chief product officer Marc Whitten tells us that most people will use this platform connected and the company still plans to bring back some of the original Xbox One features Xbox One games purchased digitally can be used by all players in a household on an Xbox One Just as discs can be played by any family member today Microsoft will allow Xbox One owners to create a virtual game library that includes different games that family members have purchased digitally Any family member will be able to pick a digital game and sign in with their account even if the original owner is not signed in Xbox One owners will also be able to play digitally downloaded games without being online Essentially Xbox Live digital games are tied to your gamertag but they re also tied to your primary console Despite this Microsoft is not commenting on when features like being able to resell digital games will become available but Whitten says Xbox One s digital vision is going to drive a lot of different business models over time Xbox One owners will be able to use a Microsoft Account as a type of digital passport to sign in and use games on another console A key part of this sharing and cloud powered Xbox Live is a new feature that Microsoft is calling Home Gold Existing Xbox Live Gold members will be able to set up an Xbox One at home and anyone who uses the console will be able to access multiplayer gaming and the entertainment apps even if the main account holder is not signed in or at home An Xbox One owner with an Xbox Live Gold subscription could also log in at a friend s house and everyone on that particular console would then be able to use multiplayer gaming and the entertainment apps while the Gold member is signed in It sounds a little complicated that s because it is but in reality Microsoft is extending its Xbox Live Gold subscription so that you don t have to buy individual subscriptions for each family member On the gaming side it means that friends can use an Xbox One owners console and play online multiplayer with their own gamertag Currently a friend would also have to subscribe to Xbox Live Gold to play online with a gamertag otherwise the friend gets the same gamertag with a number tagged on the end Although Xbox One owners will be able to sign in on other consoles and access their digital games and let friends play them too it won t be like handing a friend an unprotected MP3 that they can play over and over again with no limits Microsoft says existing Xbox Live Gold members won t have to do anything to access the new Home Gold features as they re available as part of the subscription for Xbox One and Xbox 360 consoles Despite the changes not being very different to how things are today with the Xbox 360 Microsoft says it still wants to bring the improved digital sharing features that it has retreated from to the Xbox One in time We are completely committed to the digital vision we laid out and we plan and intend to deliver all the things we said before Microsoft s Yusuf Mehdi tells us Mehdi explains that Microsoft wants to and can do it but it s seeking feedback before any future changes are made You re going to see more of the things that we talked about with digital he confirms including a Family Sharing feature that Microsoft previously revealed as an option to share digital content with family members regardless of console or location Mehdi says Microsoft still has creative pricing models for games and trial games on their list for post launch For now Microsoft is clearly approaching any potential changes with caution to avoid a backlash over policy changes that have left consumers confused by its Xbox One launch so far",

        "content": "Long after Apple s victory over Samsung in a patent suit the two companies met again today in court as a panel of judges decides whether to issue a sales ban on over two dozen Samsung devices These phones and tablets were found to use features and designs patented by Apple but so far that decision has only resulted in a major fine for Samsung in December Judge Lucy Koh found that damages were enough for Apple to recoup its losses so an out and out ban wasn t warranted Now Apple has brought its case to the Federal Court of Appeals which is set to make what could be a near final call on the issue Apple s requested ban doesn t mean much in the short term Of the 26 phones and tablets it listed 23 have been discontinued and Samsung has worked to design around Apple s patents in the remaining three Samsung meanwhile says the ban would have little impact on its design process So why does this case matter on either side For its part Apple hopes that getting an injunction will make it easier to bring cases against newer products Taking a quick dig at Samsung s design process Apple attorney William Lee said that a new Samsung device might be almost identical to an old banned one What they re saying to you is the product with this name is off the market he said If it gets the ban Apple would still need to bring more cases but it could have an easier time in court This would hurt Samsung obviously but it s not the company s only fear Any injunction it says would hurt its relationship with retail stores and carriers who would worry about whether they were accidentally selling an infringing product Likewise this could have a major impact on the second ongoing Apple vs Samsung case which should go to trial early next year Though it decisively won the original case Apple is on the defensive here Koh decided Apple hadn t proved its patents were a driving factor in how customers chose phones For Apple to get its injunction it first has to convince the court that this bar was set far too high then make a case for why it meets a different lower standard I don t think that anybody in Apple s position could absolutely prove a major link between a single feature or collection of features and sales said Lee Companies can be required to prove irreparable harm but holding Apple to this standard would be a fundamental change in American patent law he argued But Samsung has steadily claimed that the patents in question weren t major factors when buying a phone There s no proof of any infringement here being a driver much less the driver of consumer demand said Samsung lawyer Kathleen Sullivan During the case Apple presented a report showing how much customers would pay for the extra UI features Samsung copied on phones an extra 100 Sullivan questioned whether the survey itself was relevant an argument that seemed to hold little water with the judges She used the example of one car company copying another s cupholders The fact that I d pay 10 more for a car that I was going to buy anyways doesn t show that it s driving consumer demand she said It still doesn t tell you that the phone with the infringing feature will be chosen over the non infringing product she said Judge William Bryson disagreed It shows that consumers value that feature he said That seems to me to be the very essence of what a driver of demand is He then moved the question from cupholders to something like a hybrid engine which he said could be an important feature even if customers still decided on a cheaper non hybrid one It wouldn t be too surprising to see Koh s earlier decision overturned she and the appeals court have frequently disagreed on when to ban a product Early in the case the court decided she was wrong to let Samsung keep selling devices that arguably infringed on Apple s design Later though it overturned her ban on the Galaxy Nexus saying Apple hadn t proven its universal search was a major sales driver In this case the court won t be deciding whether to temporarily ban something before deciding whether it s infringing it will be making a call after a jury overwhelmingly decided that Samsung did in fact copy Apple And though Samsung s lawyer denied it the judges repeatedly asked whether she was arguing against bans for entire broad classes of lawsuits which would back up Apple s claim of a fundamental change in the law Depending on how convincing the court finds Apple s argument it could either completely uphold Koh s decision or throw it out at which point either company could potentially appeal to the Supreme Court Conversely it could hand the issue back to Koh giving her instructions to consider it further or issue specific injunctions Closure has been slow in coming with this lawsuit but today s hearing marked a step towards the end of at least one part of it",
