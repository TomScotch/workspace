        "content": "The future of television is coming into focus and it might not look all that different from the present The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that in the first publicly reported deal of its kind Viacom had reached a tentative agreement with Sony to make its popular cable TV channels available on a paid internet TV service If it happens the deal could kickstart a new era of competition between cable TV providers and the technology companies that want to carry broadcast signals over the internet But will these new alliances reshape television or will they simply repackage it for new devices Sony declined to comment and Viacom didn t respond to a request for an interview But according to the Journal Sony s long rumored service will bring cable channels like Nickelodeon and Comedy Central to the PlayStation and to Sony TVs It s part of an effort to build a credible alternative to cable that reportedly has also included talks with Walt Disney Co Time Warner and CBS The New York Times reported that Sony s service could launch by the end of the year Sony isn t the first to pursue such a deal Intel Google and Apple are all said to be seeking similar arrangements with programmers with a goal of building a so called over the top service that adds luster to the hardware they sell The deal stresses how video and TV consumption online is drastically changing traditional pay TV business models said Fernando Elizalde an analyst at Gartner in an email In Europe cable companies are already offering over the top services on smart televisions and public broadcasters are releasing apps for smart TVs Sony s relationship with Viacom is just one more of the emerging business models we are observing Elizalde said But the Viacom agreement which reportedly still needs to be finalized is the first US deal to become public knowledge As the Times notes the leak could work to Sony s advantage by making other programmers more likely to sign partnerships Even if all the agreements come together the average viewer may not find internet TV much of an improvement over the cable and satellite version What cord cutters and Sen John McCain are waiting for is an unbundled cable service that lets them purchase individual channels a la carte But nothing like that appears to be part of the Sony Viacom arrangement The devil will be in the details of what the final deal is said Jim Nail an analyst at Forrester Because the early speculation here is that Viacom will still be selling a bundle of its different networks in which case it s same thing different wire At the same time Viacom might prove to be the easiest deal Sony strikes Viacom and CBS Corp which both are under the control of media magnate Sumner Redstone regularly wage battles with cable and satellite companies over the fees they pay to carry their programming and they have no qualms about blacking it out in customers homes while negotiating Given those battles it makes sense that the company would be open to considering alternate means of distribution if only as a hedge against the cable and satellite companies amassing too much leverage But what if Sony wanted to say sign a deal with NBC Universal NBC is owned by Comcast which has little incentive to give anyone a reason to ditch its cable operator Any partnership with Sony seems unlikely at best Comcast will only take that call if they see sufficient momentum from other content providers that they feel like they have to start moving that direction Nail said Clearly the big four broadcast networks will be the last to go this direction It will take an awful lot of other movement for them to reach a point where they say We have no choice any more At the same time Nail said the Viacom agreement is significant because it shows programmers being more flexible about where and how they deliver video to their customers The traditional television business has held back technology driven change for at least a decade probably longer he said But this to me signals they can no longer just dig their heels in and say no The technology and the consumer behavior enabled by that technology are reaching that flood crest where the dam finally breaks All that said this is not the start of the great unbundling The Viacom deal suggests that consumers are about to get an alternative to the cable and satellite television packages they re used to Maybe Sony and Viacom will surprise the world by offering consumers real choices But the alternative they re building might turn out to be the same package delivered in a slightly different way and for the same high cost If that s the case the real revolution will have to keep waiting",

        "content": "In the summer of 2012 just a few months into the job RIM now BlackBerry CEO Thorsten Heins was trying to guide the company through an ongoing crisis The stock price had slipped to an eight year low BlackBerry 10 had been pushed back to the next year And a Silicon Valley investor was secretly trying to buy the company out from under its management team Yesterday entrepreneur and angel investor Robin Chan posted a slide deck for Project BBX a now abandoned plan to turn around the company with a small product and engineering team With BlackBerry now officially exploring a sale Chan s plan offers a glimpse of what BlackBerry might have become a purely business focused company with no BlackBerry 10 fewer devices and no reason to hire Alicia Keys as a creative director Instead it would focus on its trademark phones and data network leaning on iOS and Android in order to survive Chan pitched the project between June and August of last year some six months after former COO Heins stepped up to lead RIM The slides aptly pegged RIM as a company coming apart at the seams pointing to its plummeting value and utter failure to develop an app ecosystem To save it Chan tells The Verge he assembled an elite dream team of designers and engineers whose names he won t reveal The thing that surprised me is there were a lot of people who loved the BlackBerry product and were sad to see it deteriorate to such a state he says The group reached out to RIM s board of directors hoping to get enough momentum to buy out the company Essentially what we were doing was a coup d etat Ultimately the group failed to raise enough funds ending up with 1 billion rather than the minimum of 6 billion they needed to pursue the plan The team s plan for BlackBerry played to the company s obvious strengths and recognized some weaknesses that Heins wouldn t admit RIM s servers were still ubiquitous for businesses even as iOS and Android devices edged out BlackBerry phones in the office Chan referenced other symbols of the BlackBerry in its heyday including the much loved hardware keyboard and the CrackBerry moniker the only other true brand in mobile along with Apple If Apple had opened up smartphones to consumers he believed the BlackBerry could rebuild its cachet with high powered executives To do so RIM would have had to all but scrap its plans to compete with other smartphone platforms In the summer of 2012 Heins was insisting that BlackBerry 10 would be the only completely new mobile platform on the market but to Chan it was an albatross There was going to be a duopoly in operating systems between Android and iOS he says Facing those trends and riding those trends was a bigger opportunity than tinkering with what they were trying to do While Heins and RIM saw themselves in a war of operating systems they should have been focusing on the surrounding infrastructure BlackBerry 10 was misallocation of meager resources says Chan His plan would have jettisoned the upcoming platform in favor of an Android fork optimized for security and enterprise with a few BlackBerry 10 features thrown in And RIM s secure networks would have been opened up to iOS and Android an iBerry system was planned for launch within six months He compared the turnaround to that of IBM which reinvented itself by selling off its flagging hardware business Despite the comparison Chan wouldn t have discontinued hardware altogether His plan for devices was similar to what RIM ultimately released in 2013 with one keyboard and one all touch device though he also proposed a new 7 inch tablet a slide out keyboard for the all touch model and an E Ink strip for notifications A year after his proposal Chan thinks BlackBerry still has valuable resources but it s going to be a tougher sell A lot of momentum has been lost he says In a note beside his slide deck he writes that the strategy of an enterprise grade Android company is still sound but it just might be too late to save Blackberry as an independent company Tom Moss former head of business development for Android is a little more optimistic Honestly what you suggested might even still be possible today he says on Chan s Facebook wall if coupled with technology that would make apps themselves secure BlackBerry remains the platform of choice for many top businesses and government agencies and Heins adopted some of the same strategies Chan had proposed including a pared down device portfolio and limited integration with Android and iOS in the form of a BBM app Its userbase and cash reserves remain large its debt nonexistent But Chan says that even in 2012 a buyout wasn t considered a safe bet It was considered an absolutely crazy idea which was why it attracted incredibly talented people who wanted to do something ballsy he says But in general people thought it was too crazy While Chan was pitching his takeover proposal Thorsten Heins was categorically denying that RIM was in trouble in fact he insisted that there was nothing wrong with the company as it exists right now But ongoing rumors suggested that RIM might spin off its hardware or enterprise divisions all signs point to Chan being one of several people who considered picking up at least part of the company It s only now however that BlackBerry has officially acknowledged the strategic alternative of selling itself off As it does it will have to weigh its old strengths against its reinvented image and decide whether shooting for third place in the smartphone wars was worth the cost",

until he has one too many drinks and then he gets kind of creepy Before The Awl he was an editor at Gawker twice as well at The New York Observer He is also the author of Very Recent History An Entirely Factual Account of a Year c AD 2009 in a Large City available today and published by Harper I conducted an interview with Choire on Google Docs We never once took it to phone So you have written a book Is it fiction or nonfiction I read it and I m not sure Does it matter if it s fiction or non fiction This has been a really wacko cool experience that people are like Hey what the hell is this book Usually that s expressed as some complicated emoji sentence often combining the triangular poop icon with that weird one of someone in the bathtub and sometimes the gun So I think that it matters very much to me and it matters to librarians and it might matter to the people in the book who are all very real and delightful but it won t matter at all to most readers That s totally cool I mean hey You do you LOL gross sorry For the certain kind of reader who does care I am here to verify that the book is 100 percent true Every person every fact every piece of dialogue all of it Any errors of fact are mine obviously And carefully true for instance right away I declare that for a while the richest person in the city is the mayor This is true but it really was for a brief time and it was only as near as anyone could calculate It s hard to figure out who s richer than whom But definitely everyone agrees that a while back now Ol Mayor Mike got outgunned as richest bro in town Did you enjoy writing it Was it the worst How did you do it did you set aside specific chunks of time or just fit it in when the mood struck Well publishing a book the part when it goes out in the world is even worse It s kind of like when you think you re having a deep private session on Spotify and then you realize NOPE everyone can see you listening to Mariah Carey remixes Actually it s like being one of those people who put a photo up on eBay of some stupid furniture and then everyone figures out they can see you in some reflection and you re REALLY NAKED AND NOT PRETTY But yeah Writing a book basically eats a bag of dog balls You just gotta write all the time That s the secret Great fucking secret right STUPID SECRET But I firmly believe that anyone who wants to can and should do it You could be done with a book before Christmas It s actually not brain surgery because no one really agrees what a good book is so maybe even though you have no idea what you re doing it s possible everyone will be like Hey this is awesome I mean I didn t go to college I barely graduated high school and no one taught me how to write properly and then a Rupert Murdoch company gave me a decent pile of money to write a book and actually published it even though it was clearly a piece of craziness So it could happen to anyone Go for it You re probably better off learning how to trade securities though so consider that The book seems very personal in that I get the sense there are a lot of people who will read it and recognize themselves or others in it So are you now panicking asking yourself What have I done Or are you at peace with it You mean like emotionally recognize No that s good That s supposed to happen Or if you mean like IRL recognize well the number of people who d be like Oh is this person that friend of that guy is pretty vanishingly small in the world The reason the book s characters are anonymous is because we didn t think it was fair to their Google record honestly Books are short because they re between two covers but Google is forever One thing that s cool to me about the book is people talking about technology actually There s a weird long monologue by this guy who s convinced that growing up with Gchat kind of ruined him that he s so much better in chat than he is IRL I might be better in chat than I am in real life too And there s whole comedies of errors about how to communicate with people when you re simultaneously using text message Facebook and hookup sites There s Grindr there s Missed Connections Also the semi modern agony of being nonconsensually blogged about That s the worst thing Especially since you also run The Awl After editing and writing at for other places what made you want to run your OWN website Do you find it easier to work for yourself It seems like in a lot of ways it would be far far more stressful Well I could never do it without a business partner I still need someone to be accountable to Fortunately we both have the same high level of Oh all these plans went to shit FUCK IT LET S GO TO LUNCH The thing that 2008 and 2009 convinced me of and really that s what the book is about is that no employer will ever give a fuck about me Or really about most anyone Like it s all good until the funding dries up or the grants dry up or until a recession comes or until some stupid asshole rich person has a whim and decides to close up shop Then you re out on your ass and what about your commitments to your friends spouses children parents cats rents and stomachs But the money people don t care They don t have to care That s not in the agreements of how we work So fine That s not an agreement I want to have either then I think I m ruined with working for other people now Uh we ll see how that works out The fun thing about being an independently owned non investment backed company is that you have to stay profitable or it s CURTAINS for you Really more people should operate like that It s good for the soul In running an independent website what is the best part The writing editing the designing selling ads It seems like you re probably involved in all aspects of it so What is the best part and what is the worst I think we kind of love almost all of it really The good joke answer is I love delegating Which I do honestly But I particularly love editing most of the time I do hate that because we re so lean it can take a really long time to get things done that we really care about Making new sites takes forever I get jealous sometimes of people with all that borrowed cash But I don t get jealous for long Pretty much all of my least favorite things involve let s take it to phone Fuck phones People who take it to the phone Back to books for a second What is your favorite Do you have one I hate this question but it s so fun to ask My three favorite books are probably The Dispossessed Reckless Disregard Westmoreland v CBS et al Sharon v Time and hmm right now Iphigenia in Forest Hills That one s still sitting with me pretty hard Although I could probably also say My 10 favorite books are these 10 Ursula Le Guin books in this particular order What level are you on in Candy Crush Will have follow up based on your answer Oh shit Low blow Okay I am on level 272 The sad thing about this is not that I am on level 272 though that is sad but that it has disrupted my love affair with Robot Wants Kitty Do you play Robot Wants Kitty The genius of the app is that they rolled out a Kitty Connect level builder a while back and there are tons of people building games in this world And many of them are geniuses There was this guy named Fomb who built the best game levels of any game I ve ever seen And then a couple months ago now he retired I wonder what he s putting all his energy into now He s a really remarkable thinker I realize that s a big thing to say about someone who builds platform game levels If Candy Crush had existed when you were writing the book would you have finished it yet I think procrastination is good for us My writing process is Turn on loud music type for a while take a smoke break write a little while watch 30 minutes of TV write for two minutes take a shower jump out of the shower and write down some notes watch some more TV write for awhile The point being the back of our animal brain does things while we are doing other stupider things It s important Candy Crush is magical brain shut down time What kind of phone do you have Also what are the apps on your homescreen and why Like every loser I have an iPhone You know I could make the switch for the right non Apple product I go out and touch one every now and again I guess I m just scared Fine here is my homescreen This is a weird self doxx Um I never update my apps answer my phone open my Snapchats or check GroupMe or Vine so why do I have a phone anyway Actually I use it for notes for writing and for recording interviews so that s useful And cat pictures When you wake up I assume it s very early what are the first three things you read This terrible new thing happens where because I sleep with my phone under my pillow I just wake up at dawn and then turn on my phone and start wherever I stopped So this means that I often fall asleep and I reawake with half written emails or like unsent tweets that are like asdfhhjjjjjjjjjjj because I fell asleep writing them This is no way to live The upside is that the first thing I read is some random links that some English person tweeted because they re the only ones awake I saw a tweet of yours the other day of

for work and when I was away my husband used to drive him around at night He was this scrawny old beast but he d stand up on his hind legs with his front feet on the dashboard and stare out the window

        "content": "If we had the technology to rewire our brains to help remember certain things and forget others it could help millions of people struggling with neurological conditions from Alzheimer s to post traumatic stress disorder But it also raises the frightening possibility depicted over and over again in sci fi that someone would be able to use such technology to mess with people s minds without their consent For good or ill such techniques are edging closer to reality In the last few months several teams of scientists have made enormous leaps in visualizing memories and manipulating them The work is confined to animals for now but helping adjust the functioning of the human brain is the ultimate goal raising the questions just how far can and should we go In June a team of scientists led by researchers at the University of Southern California published a paper explaining that they had figured out a way to watch memories form in the brains of mice and zebrafish in real time The paper was largely overlooked by the mainstream press at the time but its implications for the future of neurobiology are enormous This provides a much clearer window into the brain than anyone s ever had before it s hard to predict where this will go from here says Donald Arnold an associate professor of molecular and computational biology at the University of Southern California who led the team Using this technique it should be possible to use this to delete and modify memory in some way he explains Microscopic image of a neuron in the brain of a living mouse showing synapses lit up with fluorescent probes Credit Donald Arnold University of Southern California Prior to the work by Arnold and his colleagues scientists weren t exactly sure how memories were encoded in the brain The basic consensus was that whenever you experience something your memory is stored in neurons specialized tree branch like nerve cells that number in the tens of billions in a single human brain and which carry information in the form of electrical signals Neurons communicate with one another across gaps known as synapses When an electrical signal carrying information say a memory reaches the end of a neuron it triggers the release of a chemical called a neurotransmitter which then floats across the synapse and lands on the receiving end of another neuron Think of pollen floating from one tree to another If all goes correctly the receiving neuron picks up the neurotransmitter and fires its own electrical signal which may cause it to release a neurotransmitter to yet another neuron It s this passage of information between neurons that lets your brain function The vividness of a particular memory is thought to be related to the strength of synapses that is how reliably the neuron fires when it picks up a neurotransmitter But scientists haven t been able to see this process of memory encoding in action until now What Arnold and his colleagues did was create a protein that sticks to the portion of a neuron responsible for absorbing the neurotransmitter called the receptor Then they took a green fluorescent protein from jellyfish and stuck that onto the other end of their protein When they implanted their glowing proteins into mice and zebrafish brains they were able to look through a fluorescence microscope and watch as their proteins collected around the receptors Microscopic image of the dendrite or electrically conductive branchlike ends of a neuron in a mouse with glowing proteins showing synaptic strength Credit Donald Arnold University of Southern California This allows us not only to see where synapses are but how strong they are by how bright and big these dots are Arnold tells The Verge We can see new synapses forming and old synapses disappearing and changes in synaptic strength Arnold says that his team s next work would involve teaching zebrafish and mice particular tasks and watching to see how their synapses change Ultimately the experiment we envision is looking at a mouse having the mouse learn something seeing how the synapses change then going back in there and modifying the synapses to see if you can get rid of the memory Arnold says Deleting a memory using this technique would involve simply sticking a natural protein made in the brain on to the same protein made by researchers which carries the glowing material It s like a guided missile you can put whatever payload you want on it Arnold says But as he says deleting memories in people using this method seems way far off to me Instead he says it would be easier to screen for drugs that would help you forget Already his team has begun work on arming the proteins they ve made to help delete some other proteins such as those that build up in the brains of those suffering neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson s and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS It s known that the vast majority of proteins in the brain turn over every week or faster Arnold says A week from now your brain is essentially built from entirely new proteins Nobody knows how that happens and your memories are retained It s crazy But in neurodegenerative diseases certain proteins that would ordinarily disappear linger and build up in brain cells causing memory problems A bit of this trash doesn t seem to get picked up it just builds and builds Arnold explains Can you get rid of the junk that builds up Why does it build up We want to at least start to answer these questions Other scientists are taking a different approaching to understanding how the brain stores and transmits information coming at it from other body parts connected to an animal s nervous system For instance a team of researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research in Germany reported earlier this week that they d successfully mapped 950 neurons in a slice of retina from a dead mouse s eye This technique could have applications for restoring sight and if applied to the brain for manipulating memory Diagram of neurons in a slice of mouse retina Credit Fabian Isensee Julia Kuhl Helmstaedter et all We can imagine that our wiring diagram of the retina can help scientists down the road design and target retinal prosthetics to the right neurons says Srinivas Turaga one of the MIT scientists involved in an email to The Verge And like you suggest with memory manipulation having a circuit diagram will tell us which neurons to manipulate and how Turaga and his colleagues created their map of the mouse retina by using an electron microscope to take 3D images of the slice of retina then having no less than 225 undergraduate students look at the images and physically trace the wiring connecting them by hand which took a collective 20 000 hours He tells The Verge that his German colleagues were working on additional microscopic technology that would be able to image larger slices and that we hope that this will eventually allow us to scan a mouse brain in about a year Turuga says that tracing all those neurons could take up to another 5 to 10 years total Still when the researchers achieve that goal they also hope to use their advances to help treat those suffering from neurological diseases Having this wiring diagram or connectome will allow us to better understand what a normal neural circuit looks like and to detect and shed light on abnormalities in the circuitry associated with neurological disorders Turaga says Once we can better understand such circuit abnormalities or connectopathies we can develop targeted methods of treatment Although some groups of scientists are getting closer to figuring out just how the brain works to store information others have already begun tinkering with memories Last week a team of scientists led by a different group at MIT made headlines around the world for their success at implanting a false memory into mouse subjects getting the mice to think that they had been painfully shocked in one location when in reality they d been shocked in an entirely different one The scientists achieved this by stimulating specific neurons in one area of the mouse brains Diagram showing light stimulation of a mouse neuron in order to implant a false memory Credit Science Magazine MIT One of the scientists involved in that MIT project neurobiologist Steve Ramirez later told The New York Times that he thought it would soon be possible to use similar techniques to delete specific parts of memories Rather than wiping out the whole memory of a relationship and an ex girlfriend as in the 2004 sci fi romantic comedy movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Ramirez says we can get rid of the sad part of that memory only Indeed humans have fantasized about being able to reprogram our minds at will since the early days of written history In ancient Greek mythology the souls of the dead were supposed to drink from a river of forgetfulness in the underworld in order to forget their lives and be reincarnated Aside from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind many other stories and movies have tackled the subject of memory manipulation from Total Recall to Inception to Dark City But some scientists think that even given all these recent advances humans won t and shouldn t ever get to the point where the scenarios described in sci fi are possible Those memory altering techniques are invasive using either genetic engineering or virus methods to manipulate genes in the mouse brain comments Joe Tsien a neurology professor who serves as co director of Georgia Regents University s Brain and Behavior Discovery Institute Tsien would know given that back in 2008 he and his colleagues successfully deleted specific memories in mice by

        "content": "Long after Apple s victory over Samsung in a patent suit the two companies met again today in court as a panel of judges decides whether to issue a sales ban on over two dozen Samsung devices These phones and tablets were found to use features and designs patented by Apple but so far that decision has only resulted in a major fine for Samsung in December Judge Lucy Koh found that damages were enough for Apple to recoup its losses so an out and out ban wasn t warranted Now Apple has brought its case to the Federal Court of Appeals which is set to make what could be a near final call on the issue Apple s requested ban doesn t mean much in the short term Of the 26 phones and tablets it listed 23 have been discontinued and Samsung has worked to design around Apple s patents in the remaining three Samsung meanwhile says the ban would have little impact on its design process So why does this case matter on either side For its part Apple hopes that getting an injunction will make it easier to bring cases against newer products Taking a quick dig at Samsung s design process Apple attorney William Lee said that a new Samsung device might be almost identical to an old banned one What they re saying to you is the product with this name is off the market he said If it gets the ban Apple would still need to bring more cases but it could have an easier time in court This would hurt Samsung obviously but it s not the company s only fear Any injunction it says would hurt its relationship with retail stores and carriers who would worry about whether they were accidentally selling an infringing product Likewise this could have a major impact on the second ongoing Apple vs Samsung case which should go to trial early next year Though it decisively won the original case Apple is on the defensive here Koh decided Apple hadn t proved its patents were a driving factor in how customers chose phones For Apple to get its injunction it first has to convince the court that this bar was set far too high then make a case for why it meets a different lower standard I don t think that anybody in Apple s position could absolutely prove a major link between a single feature or collection of features and sales said Lee Companies can be required to prove irreparable harm but holding Apple to this standard would be a fundamental change in American patent law he argued But Samsung has steadily claimed that the patents in question weren t major factors when buying a phone There s no proof of any infringement here being a driver much less the driver of consumer demand said Samsung lawyer Kathleen Sullivan During the case Apple presented a report showing how much customers would pay for the extra UI features Samsung copied on phones an extra 100 Sullivan questioned whether the survey itself was relevant an argument that seemed to hold little water with the judges She used the example of one car company copying another s cupholders The fact that I d pay 10 more for a car that I was going to buy anyways doesn t show that it s driving consumer demand she said It still doesn t tell you that the phone with the infringing feature will be chosen over the non infringing product she said Judge William Bryson disagreed It shows that consumers value that feature he said That seems to me to be the very essence of what a driver of demand is He then moved the question from cupholders to something like a hybrid engine which he said could be an important feature even if customers still decided on a cheaper non hybrid one It wouldn t be too surprising to see Koh s earlier decision overturned she and the appeals court have frequently disagreed on when to ban a product Early in the case the court decided she was wrong to let Samsung keep selling devices that arguably infringed on Apple s design Later though it overturned her ban on the Galaxy Nexus saying Apple hadn t proven its universal search was a major sales driver In this case the court won t be deciding whether to temporarily ban something before deciding whether it s infringing it will be making a call after a jury overwhelmingly decided that Samsung did in fact copy Apple And though Samsung s lawyer denied it the judges repeatedly asked whether she was arguing against bans for entire broad classes of lawsuits which would back up Apple s claim of a fundamental change in the law Depending on how convincing the court finds Apple s argument it could either completely uphold Koh s decision or throw it out at which point either company could potentially appeal to the Supreme Court Conversely it could hand the issue back to Koh giving her instructions to consider it further or issue specific injunctions Closure has been slow in coming with this lawsuit but today s hearing marked a step towards the end of at least one part of it",

        "content": "Jeff Bezos the founder of Amazon and the world s 19th richest man has acquired The Washington Post long one of the country s most influential and prestigious daily newspapers for 250 million in cash the company announced today The purchaser is an entity that belongs to Mr Bezos in his individual capacity and is not Amazon com Inc a press release issued by The Washington Post said The purchase includes all of the papers The Washington Post owns and their websites including the Express daily The Gazette Newspapers and the Southern Maryland Newspapers but does not include Slate TheRoot com or Foreign Policy which will remain with the Washington Post Company Last week Bezos sold about 185 million worth of Amazon shares though it s unclear whether the sale is connected to the acquisition By acquiring a cornerstone of Washington DC media Bezos had immediately become a player in the nation s capital and expands his already significant profile in the media world Founded 136 years ago the Post is best known for its reporting on the Watergate scandal which led to the resignation of US President Richard Nixon in 1974 That story elevated the publication from a well respected regional daily paper to an internationally recognized news organization At first glance the deal looks like a natural extension of Amazon s media strategy Much has been made of Bezos and Amazon s increasing desire to become major media producers In recent years Amazon has become an ebook publisher and enabled authors to self publish The company created a film studio to supply Amazon Instant Video with original TV shows and movies But speculation over what Amazon may have planned for a general newspaper should be tempered by the fact that the acquisition was not made by Amazon but by Bezos personally In a memo to the staff of the Washington Post Bezos praised the previous owners saying I would highlight two kinds of courage the Grahams have shown as owners that I hope to channel The first is the courage to say wait be sure slow down get another source Real people and their reputations livelihoods and families are at stake The second is the courage to say follow the story no matter the cost He also added I won t be leading The Washington Post day to day I am happily living in the other Washington where I have a day job that I love Besides that the Post already has an excellent leadership team that knows much more about the news business than I do and I m extremely grateful to them for agreeing to stay on Bezos is taking over the Post during a dark period for the publication and for newspapers in general The Post has hemorrhaged readers and revenue for many years Last week the Washington Post Company reported an operating loss of 49 3 million in the first six months of 2013 compared to a 33 2 million loss for the same period a year earlier a 14 percent decline The New York Times announced last weekend that it had sold The Boston Globe for 70 million in cash The Times which paid 1 1 billion 20 years ago for the daily newspaper had hoped to get 100 million The past decade has been a period of painful belt tightening at the Post that included the closing of overseas news bureaus a general scaling back of coverage and numerous rounds of employee buyouts The paper was at one time regarded as a peer of The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal In the mid 1990s the Post s weekday circulation topped 750 000 readers but has since fallen to 474 000 In addition the newspaper has struggled to maintain its status as the go to outlet for national politics against scrappy blogs and news organizations with far less overhead such as Politico and The Huffington Post In the past two years the Post s uncertain future has led to an exodus of many of its top writers According to Forbes Bezos has a personal net worth of 25 billion Through Bezos Expeditions he invested in at least two dozen companies including Twitter Uber and Blue Origin the commercial spaceflight company he founded according to Bezos Expeditions website In April Bezos Expeditions led a 5 million round of funding into online news blog Business Insider Thus far those investments have played little if any role in forwarding Amazon s agenda Then what does this second investment in a news organization mean Does Bezos want to be Rupert Murdoch When that investment was announced Bezos told Brad Stone of Businessweek that he saw an opportunity in how technology is streamlining news distribution and cutting out middlemen Even well meaning gatekeepers slow innovation Bezos told the magazine According to Stone Bezos is a fan of email newsletters that are short well written and are delivered right to readers via email with minimal fuss and no expense It s hard to conceive of someone repackaging the Post into an outlet for bite size news stories The newspaper has won 47 Pulitzer Prizes and the brand is associated with long form investigative journalism But shorter stories is the direction print journalism has been headed for years and there s no denying the Post is a much more diminished version of itself than the one immortalized in the Robert Redford film All The President s Men Still the acquisition of the Post should give Bezos greater access to power The paper was purchased in 1933 by Eugene Meyer and it s been in his family ever since Under the leadership of Katharine Graham Meyer s daughter the paper had a part in publishing the Pentagon Papers and it was her decision to back Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein s reporting on Watergate She became the doyenne of Washington s social scene and the paper allowed her to cultivate friendships with Presidents John F Kennedy Lyndon B Johnson and Ronald Reagan After Katharine Graham died in 2001 the company was turned over to Donald Graham one of her sons In 2008 his niece Katharine Weymouth 47 was made publisher Oddly enough the Times profiled Weymouth last week and she sounded as if she was settling in for the long haul I don t feel like my job is to be beloved Weymouth was quoted saying in the story I certainly hope to be a great publisher and if people want to love me too that s even better Weymouth said in a statement that she has agreed to stay on as both publisher and CEO of the Post For his part Bezos hasn t shown much of an interest in wielding the kind of power that the Post might supply him A libertarian Bezos has contributed relatively small sums to both major political parties Last year the CEO and his wife donated 2 5 million to a group trying to get a same sex marriage law passed in Washington And interestingly enough Amazon scored a coup last week when President Barack Obama agreed to give a speech at one of the company s warehouses As for Amazon the retailer is plenty concerned with several political issues key among them the debate over taxing online retailers Then there was the ebook scandal Many suspect that Amazon spurred the government to investigate five of the top six book publishers as well as Apple for scheming to raise and fix ebook prices a move that forced Amazon to stop discounting ebooks The feds sued and the publishers paid a 160 million settlement Apple fought in court but last month was found liable for antitrust violations So sure Bezos is now the owner of the Post and not Amazon But having a CEO who s a big shot in Washington certainly won t hurt",

        "content": "You might only drive Toyota and swear by Serta in your bedroom but you should never just pick one laptop brand and stick to it Quality varies from product to product no matter whose name is on the label so you won t see us recommending brands and you shouldn t blindly follow them Also our money says you re not a 500 laptop buyer quality decreases sharply below a certain price point so we re not going to tell you to buy something you re going to regret Instead we ve divided the world of laptop users into groups that more or less stack on top of one another from users who just want the basics like web and email all the way up to gamers who want epic power at all costs Instead of skipping down to a particular section of this guide try reading it in order Even power users need the basics to work right and there s more to your computer than your graphics card While most of what we ll talk about has to do with hardware you ll obviously have to pick an operating system for your new laptop as well Unless you re already a Linux user your choice probably comes down to Windows 8 and Mac OS X Really you can t choose wrong Windows is a little more customizable OS X better looking and Windows 8 remains a fairly polarizing operating system But both have huge app ecosystems and all the hardware support they ll need There are MacBooks that fit the bill for almost every user below and there are Windows PCs for everyone Picking an OS is a good place to start but it s a win win Even if you ll only ever surf the web write emails and cobble together the occasional Excel spreadsheet setting a minimum quality standard for your computer ensures it will do those things reliably and painlessly for years to come You don t need much but there are a few essential things you shouldn t skip or skimp on The key here is finding a computer that s inexpensive without being cheap Determining one from the other is easy too just reach out and pick up the computer Does it feel like a quality piece of hardware or a cheap heap of junk Could you see yourself hauling around this chassis and using this keyboard and this touchpad for several years The materials and parts are less important than the assembly and design and they hint at the quality of the components and circuitry inside the machine Generally when laptop manufacturers cut corners they do it everywhere simultaneously The Samsung Chromebook is a great example of an inexpensive computer that s not at all cheap It doesn t do much nor does any Chromebook Google s Chrome OS is little more than an expanded browser window But Chromebooks are well made offer solid battery life and for at home browsers and emailers may be everything you need The trade offs here are raw power and raw power may not be what you need Of course internals do matter especially if you re investing in a computer rather than buying the cheapest thing you can find Things change quickly if you want your laptop to stay snappy for a few years don t buy an outdated Intel Celeron Pentium or Atom chip when you could get a Core i3 or Core i5 Don t get an AMD C series or E series processor or even an AMD A4 when you could have an A6 or A8 inside You don t need the highest clock speed or model number but you should have the latest version Haswell is your friend right now While you used to have to look for Wi Fi USB ports a webcam and a video chip capable of HD video playback you can pretty much take those for granted Other possibly important features aren t always included if you ll ever need a DVD drive an SD card slot to import photos from a camera a VGA port to connect to old projectors or a removable battery you d better triple check they re included in your new laptop Don t even look at a computer with less than 4GB of RAM and it s a really good idea to spend a few dollars to upgrade to 6GB or 8GB it ll keep your computer running running better longer So is shelling out for a big hard drive Some laptops still ship with 320GB hard drives but filling even 500GB with 1080p movies and games is easier than you think so shoot for 750GB or 1TB for some breathing room Even if the perfect configuration s sitting there on the shelf spend a minute seeing how long it takes for the machine to open files open programs and wake up from sleep If anything seems sluggish now with a fresh machine right off the shelf just wait until it s full of apps files and games Getting the right laptop for your home office or living room is easy and shouldn t cost you more than about 800 we like the Acer Aspire M5 a lot or the Lenovo ThinkPad T430 But once you re ready to pack it up and hit the road finding the right device gets a little harder There s power and there s portability but whether you re a globe trotting executive or just a commuter there s plenty more to consider as you shop for the perfect get up and go laptop Look beyond size and weight because many of the usual comforts are often sacrificed in order to create an ultra portable computer Keyboards can be painfully shallow on thin computers so spend some time typing maybe even take an online test to see if you can keep up your normal pace If possible sit down and type with the notebook in your lap checking if the palm rests are big enough to comfortably keep the notebook from tipping Perform a few pinch to zooms two finger scrolls and swipes in from the side to test the trackpad s comfort and accuracy for navigation and gestures small computers like the Asus Taichi often mean small trackpads and you don t want that Poke at the screen too thin and light notebooks will often forgo a touchscreen and if you re buying a Windows 8 laptop you probably want a touchscreen The Intel Atom line of processors are ultra low voltage which helps reduce power consumption and lengthen battery life on devices like the HP Envy X2 But even though they come from Intel Atom chips are far less powerful than you ll likely want if you re going to sacrifice all the power of a full Core processor you might as well get a tablet In the more powerful Intel Core lineup look for a Y or U at the end of the chip s model number Y series chips are low voltage and designed to support short bursts of high performance without giving off too much heat which is perfect for notebooks that are too thin for an internal fan Likewise U series processors were designed for ultra portable notebooks so they operate with very low voltage These all come with power tradeoffs but we might soon be able to have it all the first Intel Haswell powered laptops we ve tested offer fantastic battery life Manufacturers will usually list a notebook s expected battery life but you should assume that a notebook will only last around 70 percent of the manufacturer s claim This isn t always the case the newest MacBook Air does even better than its advertised 12 hours but it s a good rule of thumb Many thin and light notebooks like the Toshiba Kirabook trade a traditional hard drive for a solid state drive SSD which is much faster and lighter and has no moving parts You ll have to sacrifice some storage space but you ll see a dramatic improvement in the amount of time it takes for your notebook to boot and wake from sleep Some notebooks will offer a combo drive traditional hard drive for storage plus a small solid state cache drive but going full SSD makes your computer both better and more portable If you know you re going to need a lot of storage it might be better to buy an external drive as a permanent home for your photos music and movie collection A backlit keyboard isn t always a guarantee with new notebooks but will come in handy when you re working on a dimly lit plane or hammering away in a dark alley world traveling is a dangerous game And since you re not likely to want to travel with a 17 inch laptop some sort of standard video out port will come in handy if you need a second monitor or bigger screen HDMI is the video port of choice for Windows notebooks while Apple notebooks generally include a Mini DisplayPort or Thunderbolt connection Avoid any laptops that use a proprietary display port or really any proprietary port in general as the cables are often more expensive and much harder to replace If you can t stand not being connected some notebooks have embedded mobile broadband but these are both rare and expensive and tethering to your phone works just as well LTE laptops are essentially million miler purchases only At this point you re still just doing the basics Word documents Gmail iPhoto maybe a little Netflix All that s changed is how often you re near an outlet What happens next when you need your laptop to become your stereo your TV and your cable box too Can it play games is the wrong question Every laptop can play games The question is how well and the answer relies on balancing four different components the graphics chip the processor the screen and the amount of power and cooling in the laptop The higher the resolution of your screen the more detail you can see in a game That s why you ll almost certainly want to look for a 1080p screen like on the Toshiba Qosmio X870 But filling a 1080p screen with Borderlands 2 is a lot more challenging than on a 1366 x 768 display and only a powerful graphics card can keep up Here higher numbers generally mean better products like picking a GeForce GTX 765M instead of a GeForce GT 750M See our chart on the right for how mobile GeForce chips actually stack up if you think a 720M is more powerful than a 640M you d be surprised But it gets more complicated the more powerful the graphics chip you buy the more powerful the processor you ll want Of course once you stick a powerful processor and a powerful graphics chip into a computer the laptop will need plenty of cooling and plenty of power to actually run those components at full tilt You need all four parts right or you re going to have an even rougher time getting through Dark Souls than you would anyway the only way to know for sure is to actually play games so whatever you buy make sure you use your return window wisely The highest profile game titles can take up tremendous amounts of storage space Max Payne 3 alone consumes 30GB so you ll want a 1TB drive or larger inside your laptop Make sure you have 8GB of RAM at a minimum but don t worry about the RAM s speed Also don t pay attention to video memory manufacturers try to make an extra buck by advertising more video memory than the GPU actually needs Games include a lot of fast motion and dark environments so ensure the screen displays relatively deep blacks even when the brightness is turned up and that even if you quickly move things on screen there s no ghosting where you can see afterimages because the screen hasn t caught up or tearing where the on screen images appear to rip apart For online gaming you ll want high quality Wi Fi or better yet a wired Ethernet port which is more rare than you might think For Wi Fi look for 802 11 a b g n not b g n or 802 11ac Both are sure signs that the laptop can use the faster typically more reliable 5GHz wireless band If you do get the chance to test in person make sure the laptop stays cool and comfortable under its load particularly around the WASD keys and near where you ll place your mouse hand While good gaming graphics are making their way into an increasing number of thin and light computers you ll pay a pretty penny for an actual powerhouse like the hefty Alienware 14 But if you re after world domination insane scientific calculation or a second career in Bitcoin there s one more step to take Let s be clear again almost no one needs a computer this powerful But if you re willing to push the definition of laptop to its very breaking point and spend thousands upon thousands of dollars you can get a system with performance rivaling a high end desktop PC These bonkers superpowered laptops are usually made by Clevo or Sager There are a number of resellers online and most will carry at least one machine that supports desktop processors multiple graphics cards and gobs of memory Try a hexacore Core i7 3970X Extreme Edition processor a workstation class Nvidia Quadro K5000M graphics chip and 32GB of RAM Throw in three enterprise grade solid state drives and a fancy paint job and you re in for just over 13 000 Just don t forget to justify your purchase to friends and family by explaining how you ll make a mint mining Bitcoins and prepare a clever distraction for when they ask about your blossoming electricity bill Blame your refrigerator Whether you buy a laptop in a brick and mortar store or from an online retailer you ll want to put it through its paces before committing for the long haul In 10 minutes by asking the right questions you can leave confident that you ve found a winner or avoided a lemon Does it feel like it s made of cheap plastic Do its metal surfaces feel more like a soda can than strong quality aluminum How much glossy translucent plastic covers the laptop and can you scratch it with your fingernail Are there particularly obnoxious seams in the frame and does it feel like the laptop would crack open if you ever dropped it a few feet When you open and close the hinge does it feel like you re going to break off the lid and does the screen stay in place Do the colors on that screen go funky when you angle it slightly Does it get as bright and as dim as you d like and does it do so without washing out When you press down on the keyboard firmly does the whole surface give beneath your fingers Do the keys feel mushy or so firm they make your joints ache Could you imagine yourself spending full work days typing out a college thesis using those keys Can you type without the mouse cursor jerking around and can you comfortably and quickly make that cursor move where you d like Does the computer boot quickly and does it wake quickly from sleep Do programs open immediately or is there an annoying delay Do the hardware buttons for volume brightness and so on work as soon as you press If there s a touchscreen does it perform to your satisfaction Most salespeople want to see you leave the store with the right notebook for you but that doesn t mean there s no sales fluff and when in doubt ignore the fluff External monitors and storage drives are frequently suggested as a complimentary sale but it s probably best to wait and see if you actually need either before making the purchase An HDMI cable may be a smart add on if you plan to connect your notebook to your television or another external monitor but don t purchase the one they offer there s no resolution difference between a 5 cable from Amazon and an 80 cable From cables to software to the external mouse you probably don t need most things are probably cheaper somewhere other than at the register of your local Best Buy Before accepting a store s extended insurance plan check and see if you have a credit card that automatically offers buyer s protection Select cards from all four major credit companies will offer purchase protection or extended warranties on purchased items without charging any additional fees If not be sure to read the details about what s covered and what s not before you shell out the extra money for the manufacturer s policy Apple s support is the easiest to use with a growing number of Apple Stores and up to three years of service and support with the AppleCare Protection plan Best Buy also offers in person support with Geek Squad protection but this is in addition to any manufacturer s warranty on a notebook",

        "content": "For Brin a billionaire who wears Google Glass in the promo video for the Cultured Beef project maybe that s true he s already living in a future where man can augment himself and surpass any obstacle For the rest of us meat actual beef which has never been an animal undercuts one of our basic assumptions about it For us to eat meat something must die The research Brin is funding is according to its leader Post about 20 to 25 years away from producing a commercially available product but they re clearly working at a breakneck pace to reach their goals If they succeed they would be part of a long and concerted effort to change the way that we the human race eat every single day It would broadly affect our health our well being our environment and our sense of who we are and the creatures we share the planet with A growing consensus among scientists doctors environmentalists and animal rights activists suggest that our current system of food specifically meat production is not sustainable By 2050 the global demand for meat will double as our population continues to rapidly grow The effects of all this farming on our environment are currently devastating and getting worse Simply put we are destroying the planet and meat production and consumption is arguably the most to blame This is why people like Post and his team are not the only ones working on solutions there is a small but growing community who with financial backing and vocal support from some of the most powerful technologists and VCs in Silicon Valley hope to apply scientific innovations to the course of human history and change the way we live This lofty desire to apply our brains to complicated seemingly overwhelming problems in fact is the story of human history And really in a way it all comes down to meat And yes that sounds like science fiction Sergey It s fair to say that meat eating is critical to our history Joseph Ferraro an anthropologist at Baylor University says and without the consumption of meat we would not have large brains and wouldn t be where we are today When humans really got started on earth there weren t very many of us and we weren t very smart Man was outnumbered by orders of magnitude for millennia by animals Two million years ago if you were just plopped down into a random point on the inhabited earth Ferraro says you probably wouldn t have seen another person for days or even weeks The population he says was probably close to 10 000 What you would have seen Ferraro explains is a vast number of animals Men and animals evolved together on the planet over the course of thousands of years with a supportive relationship crucial to our evolution A paper Ferraro co authored this past April suggests that early humans began to hunt or at least to scavenge and butcher animals for food around 2 million years ago And at just about that time we see big shifts in the human fossil record of the increase in brain size increase in body size and hominins leaving Africa for Eurasia he says Around 10 000 years ago humans began practicing agriculture in earnest and with it the process of bringing other animals into the domestic circle All of this has meant that for most of our history men and animals have had a complex and emotional give and take relationship For a very high percentage of the 7 billion people living on earth what to eat is not a decision that is made so much as it is passed on to us from our parents Most people have historically eaten similarly to their families if you re Hindu for example you might not eat cows and if you re Jewish you sometimes avoid pork or seafood There are also regional differences in what we eat informed by a host of evolutionary geographic cultural and religious practices For most of human history we ate what was local because there were no airplanes steamships or refrigerated trucks to bring us exotic or non local foods Plants that were found to be poisonous were added to the arsenal of things we don t eat Over time however culture took over and man began to form customs for what food mostly animals was for eating and what was not Generally all bets are off in times of starvation but our ideas about food are deeply ingrained in our communities and we haven t bothered to examine them very closely We figured out how to hunt Ferarro says and that enabled so much of our development Eventually it allowed the population to explode This presented us with a new challenge how to scale the hunt Those are chickens said Crake Chicken parts Just the breasts on this one They ve got ones that specialize in drumsticks too twelve to a growth unit But there aren t any heads That s the head in the middle said the woman There s a mouth opening at the top they dump nutrients in there No eyes or beak or anything they don t need those Margaret Atwood Oryx and Crake 2003 We teach children that Old MacDonald had a farm and that on that farm he had a cow moo moo a goat baa baa a chicken cluck cluck and a pig oink oink The reality most of us know is that Old MacDonald was largely replaced long ago by massive operations run by multinational corporations that often don t even bear the name farm Family farms were responsible for 90 percent of the United States chicken production until around the 1960s Today it is estimated that approximately 99 percent of the animals raised for slaughter in the US live on factory farms Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries families increasingly grew and produced less of their own food on small farms and those operations were consolidated into the growing food industry which began to apply manufacturing techniques to the raising of livestock so that the growing millions then billions could be fed fast and cheap By the middle of the 20th century factory farms were so ubiquitous that the Old MacDonald farms of our childhood imaginations were quickly becoming an endangered species These are just a few of the ways in which factory farms are able to meet the ever increasing demand for animal based food The availability of large quantities of cheap meat has unsurprisingly increased demand steeply The average person in the US now eats about 270 pounds of meat a year Beef consumption has gone down but overall consumption of fish meat poultry and eggs has continued to rise steadily Over the past 100 years meat consumption has steadily grown in proportion to the rest of our diets now composing roughly 15 percent of the calories in the average US citizen s diet Thanks to population growth and demand in developing nations meat consumption globally is predicted to double by the year 2050 All of this comes at a very high cost a cost which many experts say will be devastating There are other devastating effects on the environment too the EPA estimates that runoff which it regulates from factory farms into waterways is the largest single pollutant in the US Livestock also drink about half of the country s potable water each year and they produce more excrement than humans waste which is usually just spread on the ground further contaminating the water and remember there s a decent amount of antibiotics in that waste too This is what people mean when they tell you as Ashley Byrne of PETA told me that factory farming is unsustainable The population explosion means more mouths to feed and meat consumption overall has been on the rise proportionally to the rest of our diets this increases pressure to raise more animals and more food to feed them which in turn gravely stresses our environment The huge number of animals produces waste and polluting byproducts and eventually we re going to not only simply lack the livestock to meet demand but will face the high environmental costs to boot Most experts believe that our effect on climate change is reversible but only if we act immediately Initiatives like Meatless Monday which encourages families to replace meat in just one weekly meal have proven quite popular But for most people when you cut out meat you need to replace it with something Americans aren t going to go for a plant based diet that easily right And that s where a handful of new Silicon Valley funded companies swoop in Meat eaters know the feeling you re at a barbecue with friends or around the table at a family holiday and the one lone vegetarian drops a pale tofu dog on the fire or pulls a basketball shaped Tofurkey out of the oven Maybe they don t know they re missing out maybe they do Either way what they re eating doesn t look that great does it Does it taste like meat Does it even matter To the vegetarian it usually really doesn t Meatless meats have been around for a long time big names in the market include Boca Burger owned by Kraft Foods Morningstar Farms and Gardenburger both owned by Kellogg s and Lightlife ConAgra But the new companies trying to create meat alternatives or meat replacements aren t really trying to go after vegetarians We already have them says Ethan Brown CEO of Los Angeles based Beyond Meat and we know that His company founded in 2009 was privately funded by Kleiner Perkins and The Obvious Corporation Obvious is a web incubator that was founded in 2006 by Evan Williams and Biz Stone and has gone on to also create and launch products like Medium The goal is to get everyone else on board For Beyond Meat and a handful of other companies such as Hampton Creek Foods a San Francisco based startup that makes egg replacement products the model is pretty straightforward They work in concert with world class food scientists to come up with meat alternatives let s call them Tofurkey 2 0 for consumer products that aren t only better tasting than their ancestors but they re healthier and often cheaper and marketed in a way that meat eaters won t be turned off of Hampton Creek Foods takes a similar approach but it s trying to convince people to replace eggs An easier sell if you consider that many doctors regularly suggest people limit their egg consumption anyway with 184 mg of cholesterol egg yolks contain one of the highest concentrations per serving of any food which in addition to foods high in saturated fat raise cholesterol levels in the blood But it s also true that eggs are the most consumed animal protein in the world says Josh Tetrick CEO of Hampton Creek Foods People have been using egg based egg replacements for years but a lot of those products aren t good for baking or using in recipes or they aren t that much cheaper than eggs themselves The goal of Beyond Eggs Hampton Creek s egg product is to function just like an egg regardless of how it s being used and still be cheaper than eggs Their powdered egg alternative is made from peas and sorghum among other things It s totally plant based Hampton Creek Foods is funded by Khosla Ventures which routinely supports technology based environmentally disruptive businesses and also by Gates himself through Khosla For both of these companies selling to consumers is only part of the equation Selling wholesale to other much larger food companies is also a big piece of their business If we can convince a General Mills that our product will be cheaper and taste just as good Tetrick says that s how we succeed And he s probably correct if General Mills can use a cheaper egg substitute that tastes identical in its processed foods or baked goods who will know or care I started out wanting to create a world changing business Tetrick says He doesn t bother using the word vegan on his products though they are in fact animal free In many ways Tetrick is angling to change the world s egg consumption the way that margarine changed the world s butter consumption by being much cheaper while still behaving a lot like the original There s a lot of money to be made in these startups they re nascent markets ready for growth Astute money men people like Khosla or Gates are often best at seeing the future and in this case they see tremendous market potential in the words of Gates They re small companies which apply scientific methods and develop their products in labs and at universities And they have the environment in mind Ethan Brown sees reducing meat consumption by 25 percent as a reasonable goal and one which would have a very very positive impact on the environment according to experts like Robert Goodland whom he cites But what about your hardliner The person who regardless of health food safety environmental or ethical concerns just wants a great burger made of real beef at his weekend brunch He hasn t been forgotten either In fact he s getting arguably the biggest chunk of money and scientific research in food technology Because in this case the goal is nothing less than putting the egg before the chicken Or more properly the chicken breast before the chicken or even the burger before the cow Fifty years hence we shall escape the absurdity of growing a whole chicken in order to eat the breast or the wing by growing these parts separately in a suitable medium Winston Churchill 1936 Since the 1990s the possibility of growing animal cells in a lab by using stem cells has become a viable prospect NASA spent the early 2000s working with turkey stem cells and the first edible specimen cultured goldfish cells were successfully produced in 2002 In the United States the effort to grow meat in a lab has been most vocally supported by Jason Matheny who in 2005 authored an influential paper in the journal Tissue Engineering a paper responsible for renewed interest in the topic of growing meat in a lab in the US In 2009 he told the University of Chicago Magazine that cultured meat will be the purest meat ever lacking the additives antibiotics and growth hormones given to most livestock today In 2004 he founded New Harvest a non profit dedicated to raising awareness of in vitro meat also called test tube meat or cultured meat In 2008 Mark Post began investigating culturing meat in a lab with 4 million in funding from the Dutch government When that funding ended Matheny worked to broker a deal for Brin to begin funding Post s work though it was done anonymously until last week Nicholas Genovese of the University of Missouri estimates that around 30 labs most of them at universities often with some private funding are working on creating cultured meats It s nearly identical in some ways to research being done in tissue engineering and organ creation work both using stem cells Geneovese s own work has been funded by PETA for the past two years In 2008 PETA announced a 1 million prize for the first lab to successfully grow test tube chicken We want to focus on chicken Ashley Byrne of PETA says because chickens are the most widely abused animals in the world Most scientists are focusing on one particular part of the problem says Genovese For example he s working on creating the best non animal medium in which to grow the cells The process of creating meat in a lab is a complex one In the simplest of terms the most common procedure begins with extracting stem cells from a live adult animal A growth serum Post s contains animal blood but future growth mediums will be animal free is then added to the cells which are grown on a scaffolding like a skeleton to form a muscular structure This muscle is often exercised to create a richer tastier flesh There are of course serious challenges to getting a product to market and at the scale which would be required There s still no fat in the meat and for a product to be marketable it s going to need to be nearly identical to real meat or it will simply be an expensive Gardenburger as one environmental scientist with doubts about the project called it It s also insanely expensive right now calling Post s tester the 325 000 burger as the media has over and over is generous Post s research has cost conservatively in the realm of 5 million so far But theoretically there s no reason this product couldn t be much cheaper than meat from an animal in the future that s how it worked in Neuromancer and it makes sense mathematically The final challenge however is whether people will buy it Can we get over our sense of how weird cultured meat is To me Ethan Brown says that will all be a question of how it s marketed Once we stop talking and thinking about it as the Frankenburger we ll go a long way towards realizing just how world changing such a product could be Of course there are those who say we don t have 20 to 25 years left to address the environmental issues For them the in vitro meat project even if successful is just too far off and they believe that people need to reduce their meat consumption now to impact the environment positively But that s not going to stop us from trying And it s not going to stop people like Sergey Brin who see business opportunities in addition to the ability to address ethical and environmental concerns from pouring money into projects that the rest of us still think of as science fiction Two million years ago there were probably naysayers too laughing at the guy with the DIY spear running after a bear And there were also probably plenty of people who disagreed when it was first suggested that you could raise massive quantities of animals and that meat could be something which even poor people could afford to eat on a daily basis At every turn man s innovative nature has answered the call to solve critical problems Why should this time be any different",

        "content": "Plans for a third runway and a sixth terminal at Heathrow were approved by the UK government in 2009 but were scrapped a year later following a change in leadership Some of the strongest opposition to expansion has come from local community groups councils and grassroots organisations John Stewart chairman of the Heathrow Association for the Control of Aircraft Noise HACAN tells The Verge that some 725 000 local residents are affected by Heathrow aircraft noise which amounts to more than a quarter of all people suffering from aircraft noise in Europe Whether departing or arriving most planes have to follow a flight path directly over London and their environmental impact has drawn the ire of more than just the locals Before the 2009 plan was announced Greenpeace and a group of celebrity endorsers purchased a plot of land at Heathrow in order to obstruct the building of a third runway Heathrow s response to these concerns has been bullish the operating company argues that it can deliver a sustainable airport that will handle more flights with less noise It already levies a variable landing charge that incentivizes airlines to use quieter aircraft and it also has a flightpath respite scheme that aims to spread out the noise by alternating runways These and other efforts have helped Heathrow reduce its noise footprint over recent years while growing to handle nearly half a million flights per year Even with 70 million passengers and 1 5 million metric tons of cargo passing through Heathrow annually business leaders maintain that greater expansion is absolutely essential Without it the argument goes the surrounding region risks losing jobs as well as its international competitiveness with airports like Frankfurt Amsterdam s Schiphol and Paris Charles de Gaulle ready to pounce on any business that Heathrow can t handle These economic interests are in direct conflict with the concerns of local residents and environmental groups leaving open the thorny question of what is to be done The UK Airports Commission has been set up specifically to tackle the multifaceted challenge of expanding London s air connectivity and is presently assessing more than 50 different proposals Heathrow itself is pitching in three different options for constructing that controversial third runway The airport authority claims that expansion of its infrastructure would deliver a 100 billion 155BN boost to the UK economy at a cost of 14 billion nearly 22BN and with a completion date in 2025 Ambitious as ever each of the Heathrow proposals also allows room for a fourth runway should one ever prove necessary However profitable it may turn out to be the idea of a four runway Heathrow is already being disputed by anti expansion campaigners John Stewart of HACAN goes for intentional understatement when he describes Heathrow s estimates as hugely optimistic He also points out that flight demand could be drastically reduced if oil prices rise or the industry s tax breaks are curtailed HACAN and other skeptical groups support more incremental upgrades to London s Gatwick and Stansted airports as a means to reduce Heathrow s burden London Mayor Boris Johnson has advanced a far more radical plan for the outright replacement of Heathrow with a multi runway hub airport to be built atop a man made island in the estuary of the River Thames He has since moved to support an alternative plan authored by renowned architect Sir Norman Foster that pitches a similar four runway behemoth to take over Heathrow s role of primacy Among the key benefits touted by these plans is a lower noise impact allowing the airport to operate 24 hours a day plus a cohesive layout that would cut flight connection times down to 45 minutes The cost of the Foster Partners bid is estimated at 24 billion 37BN which the designers claim can be raised through private investment with the project becoming partially operational in 2029 Accounting for all potential economic benefits the Thames Hub Airport would deliver 75 billion 116BN paying off its initial costs within the first decade These numbers don t compare well to the projected timescale or revenues of a Heathrow expansion however they re also not subject to the same burden of widespread public disapproval Gatwick and Stansted offer the most modest ideas with the former airport asking for a frugal 9 billion 14BN to get a new runway up and running by 2025 The vision is for London s air traffic to be redistributed among a constellation of competing airports which is expected to result in up to 56 billion 87BN of economic growth As Mayor Johnson s competing proposal points out however fragmenting London s air connectivity in that fashion would deprive the city of its ability to function as a hub for connecting flights which it is ideally positioned to do given its centrality in the developed world The alternatives to Heathrow are numerous varied and in some ways preferable but they may already be irrelevant The Financial Times reported this week that none of the major airline alliances currently operating out of Heathrow are willing to move away SkyTeam the Oneworld Alliance and the Star Alliance among whose members you ll find Delta United Swissair Lufthansa and both British and US Airways are all equally resolute in their commitment to Heathrow The FT also notes that SkyTeam has already declared that relocating to another London or UK airport is not an option for our members The independent Airports Commission will offer its preliminary report on the various pitches for air capacity expansion by the end of this year It ll suggest incremental strategies to cover the UK s short and mid term aviation goals but the Commission s final assessment will be reserved until summer 2015 With Heathrow s established cachet as a global brand improving customer satisfaction ratings and almost universal airline support that 2015 report is shaping up to recommend a future that looks like a bigger version of the present",

        "content": "Sometimes a laptop is more than just a laptop It can also serve as the center of your digital entertainment life melding your TV stereo and media players into one machine Here a high resolution widescreen display is a must but not all 1080p screens are created equal Bright and vivid are good but take a moment to view the screen from multiple angles check for image distortion or inverted colors Make sure it gets bright enough to avoid the glare from your lamps dim enough to not destroy your eyes in the dark and that blacks and whites don t look a little more like yellow and gray You d be surprised how hard it is to find a laptop that shows honest to goodness black and no movie looks as cool without it Choosing a glossy or a matte screen is largely personal preference glossy tends to look brighter and more vibrant matte works outdoors but having a laptop you can see That s pretty universal Frankly the best laptops won t beat even a decent set of external speakers but some notebooks definitely sound better than others The best way to get a sense of audio quality is to turn the volume up to its highest setting and play a movie trailer followed by a couple songs from different genres Higher pitches will often sound mechanical or tinny at higher volumes and weak bass will make an action scene in a movie sound flat Built in subwoofers are generally a good thing but don t be distracted by meaningless branding a Bang and Olufsen or Beats Audio sticker does not guarantee good audio performance Generally the best quality speakers run along the sides or the top of the notebook and will face slightly toward you Movie and music collections aren t getting any smaller so look for a laptop that will support a few more years of downloads and purchases A 1TB drive should be plenty of room to get started but anything smaller may start to feel cramped as your collection grows 500GB is barely enough space for 10 Blu ray rips Unlike the frequent traveler epic battery life doesn t need to be high on your priority list but you ll want to make sure that the notebook isn t going to die in the middle of a couch bound Netflix session A notebook that claims to get five hours of battery life may only get closer to three during normal use and with high res screens and booming speakers it s rare to find a media friendly laptop with great battery life like the Sony VAIO Pro so don t expect a movie marathon We ve talked about a lot of things so far but the basic internal requirements haven t really changed When you want to switch from watching and listening to creating and editing though they do change Quickly If you re committing serious time to things like video editing and music creation pay serious attention to processor speed and RAM Look for a notebook with at least a quad core processor say an Intel Core processor whose name ends in QM for quad core instead of U for ultra low voltage or M for mobile You ll want to have at least 8GB of RAM and 16GB or even 32GB will improve rendering speeds and help with multitasking when you re running Photoshop Premiere and GarageBand all at once Apple notebooks like the MacBook Pro with Retina display are a favorite among content creators just for the software that comes preinstalled The iLife app suite includes everything you need to get started editing photos video and music using iPhoto iMovie and GarageBand Final Cut Pro X one of the most popular professional video editing apps is only available for OS X but Adobe s Premiere suite and others give you the option to edit on Windows as well You should look for a notebook with a combination hard drive and SSD which will allow for a large storage capacity along with the speed bump of flash memory Storage space is crucial here as even short movie scenes can be comprised of several shots takes and edits a few minutes of home video will fill up your drive faster than you think A notebook with 1TB of storage will be a good start but you ll probably soon need an external storage drive for even more space Look for a notebook with USB 3 0 or Thunderbolt ports which support high speed file transfer rates between your laptop and external drives Don t expect amazing battery life with a notebook this powerful don t forget your charger if you need to be editing on the go or really doing much of anything At this point we re well beyond what most people need from their laptop But if you re not most people if you re battling through the airborne terrors of Bioshock Infinite but not on your Xbox 360 you re going to need a bigger boat It s easy to categorize buying a laptop as coming upon a fork in the road this way lies power this way portability The actual process is more complicated and much more rewarding you don t have to sacrifice one for the other if you look in the right places And even if you buy a powerful portable computer you re going to hate it if it has a terrible keyboard and trackpad or if you can hardly see the display or if you ll need to charge it more often than you need a coffee refill Since you re going to be spending most of your days in front of your laptop it s worth getting right The key to choosing is to pick what s right for you and to be realistic If you don t play games don t buy a gaming PC if you play too many games but wish you played fewer you should probably still get a gaming PC just in case Make sure you re hitting a few baselines on the spec sheet but only splurge for more power in the places you ll need it There s no one size fits all laptop out there That s the best part With a little tailoring and attention you can get the perfect laptop for you And seriously avoid anything called a netbook",

        "content": "Before that humans were predominantly plant eaters Meat is rarely a majority of the diet of any human even today Ferraro says our diets and those of hunter gatherers were still primarily vegetative fruit with that extra meat component Once our innovations and technological advances meant that we could start hunting however the animal food seems to have enabled some of our most critical early evolutionary processes The key thing about meat he says however wasn t intrinsically the meat itself it was a lot of calories a lot of nutrients and vitamins and minerals in these packages meat was the only possible source at the time and place in man s evolution The history of man and animal is more complicated than a simple hunting relationship of course humans began to domesticate the gray wolf the origin animal of all currently domesticated dogs around 33 000 years ago some estimates and evidence exist for a much much earlier relationship giving us a source of fur security beasts of burden and eventually the companionship which dogs are predominantly known for today In US law factory farms are called concentrated animal feeding operations CAFOs for short In practice factory farms are very large four farms in the United States produce 80 percent of the cattle raised for slaughter and half of the chickens They re operations that raise livestock in highly confined high density conditions with more than 125 000 animals under one roof The largest food production company in the United States is Tyson Foods which reported a revenue of 32 billion in 2011 Tyson employs 115 000 people and has 400 operation centers in the United States It works with nearly 7 000 farms who supply it with animals for the final stages of life slaughter and processing The life cycle of an animal through large scale farming operations is generally birth at a farm most come from factories as defined by the EPA movement to a feedlot for finishing a highly confined city for animals and finally processing at a plant such as Tyson In 2010 Tyson processed slaughtered an average of 42 3 million chickens 143 000 cows and nearly 390 000 pigs per week The company makes its profit by processing animals in efficient and brutal circumstances For example in 1925 the average Tyson chicken lived approximately 112 days weighed around 2 5 pounds at the time of slaughter and had consumed about 4 7 pounds of grain per pound of its body weight In 2010 the same chicken lived just 45 days was slaughtered at an average weight of 5 63 pounds and consumed just 1 92 pounds of grain per pound Simply put the animals live less than half as long eat half as much and are more than double the size they were 100 years ago The efficiency of these operations has enabled them to produce an ever increasing amount of animals for ballooning profits The first few decades of the 20th century saw the introduction of vitamin supplements Combined with artificial lighting it allowed animals to be raised indoors chickens will even lay eggs year round now and at increasing body weights The advent of refrigeration meant that animal meat could be kept much longer and transported farther distances before going bad A growing understanding of genetics led to the selective breeding of the strongest healthiest birds In the 1950s livestock vaccination became standard Around the same time the largest and most often cited technological advance in factory farming came with the introduction of low grade antibiotics into the chickens feed and water supply Farmers were raising animals in such large quantities that disease could quickly and easily wipe out huge numbers of them the application of antibiotics it was thought would lessen some of that risk It also meant they could be raised in far less sterile conditions But there was also an unforeseen consequence the animals quickly grew fatter Antibiotics it turns out kill off the bacterium which makes up the microbiome found in the guts of all animals and helps digest carbohydrates Unable to process the bacteria the animal puts on weight and fast The cause of such rapid weight gain wasn t understood until early 2013 but it became a standard method of fattening livestock in the 1950s Today around 80 percent of all antibiotics produced in the US are used for livestock We have three options moving forward says Sergey Brin in the Cultured Beef promo As he tells it we can all become vegetarians we can continue to destroy the planet or we can try something new Vegetarianism is on the rise by some estimates it s at an all time high of 10 percent in the United States but it also feels fair to agree with Brin when he dismisses it as the most likely way to address our problems even as some meat eaters reduce their consumption People know that how they eat affects their health Dr Donald Smith of Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City says and that affects their behavior Beef consumption has been on a slight decline in the US in recent decades partially because people have recognized it s better for their hearts a 2001 study found that people who avoided meat were far healthier especially in terms of coronary heart disease and 40 percent less likely to develop cancer compared to meat eaters There is a growing market of educated consumers Brown says They shop at places like Whole Foods incidentally the first place Beyond Meat sold its products to These consumers Brown says some of whom are vegetarians but many who are not are health conscious and they care about the environment Beyond Meat started in June of 2012 by selling a chicken like product to Whole Foods which used it in prepared foods such as chicken salad In April of 2013 their consumer packaged Chicken less Strips were put on Whole Foods shelves nationwide The products are vegan and made from a combination of soy and vegetable proteins What we envision Brown says are supermarket aisles where in the future you ll have two choices meat or meat free protein sold side by side You won t need to go to a special vegetarian section in most supermarkets he says because most people will eat a combination of both Beyond Meat s products are attractively packaged the food itself looks a lot more like meat than its meatless 1 0 predecessors I tasted Beyond Meat s chicken alternative Microsoft founder Bill Gates wrote this past March and honestly couldn t tell it from real chicken At Mark Post s London tasting both Hanni R tzler and Josh Schonwald noted the same thing was missing from the meat fat Post calls it a technical bottleneck and it s one of the next phases of research What we love about meat is the fat that s what makes it taste good says Ethan Brown but it s also the least healthy part of the meat For people developing cultured meat however the goal is to get it as close to the real thing as possible fat and all They re going to get there Isha Datar director of New Harvest says it s just a question of when Post estimates that within 20 to 25 years we could have a commercial product lab grown beef which is indistinguishable from that which comes from an animal grown in a lab Theoretically one crop of stem cells could create a huge amount of meat with no animals harmed no grazing land needed grown in a sterile environment This product would address all of the major concerns of large scale farming today Datar says environmental health and ethical PETA thinks their chicken challenge is likely to bring a product to market in far less time though I do think we ll make the goal within the next few years Byrne says",
