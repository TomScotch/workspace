LAPTOP Today s slender laptops are the crown jewel of the back to school buy By elementary school most students will need access to a computer whether at home or on the go If they are of an age where they need to pack one around with them you ll want to find something that has an all day battery life is sturdy yet lightweight and small so that it can fit in a backpack and that won t be obsolete in a year or a two In this category it s hard to beat the MacBook Air which is as portable as they come the 11 inch model weighs just over 2 pounds and has truly extraordinary nine hours of battery life Prices start at 950 with student discounts Another great pick is the new Sony Vaio Pro 13 which is one of the best new ultrabooks I ve ever reviewed Its fourth generation Intel processor delivers ultra fast speeds masters the most demanding tasks and keeps the battery boosted all day long Prices on this little beauty start around 1 250 If you re on a tight budget and you d still like to get a lightweight laptop don t despair Samsung s 11 inch Chromebook starts at just 250 It s runs Google s Chrome operating system instead of Mac OS or Windows and focuses on running applications over the Internet This means the Chromebook could take a while to get used to but that s not a big deal since kids are so tech adaptable Overall it does a fine job doing most things your average student needs like researching topics online or writing papers with online tools like Google Docs FOR TAKING NOTES LIVESCRIBE SKY WI FI SMARTPEN Today s students have a modern equivalent of the No 2 pencil on steroids in the Livescribe Sky Wi Fi Smartpen It records a digital copy of what you write and draw as well as audio of your class lectures You just takes notes normally then later go back tap any word

I used bright pink duct tape for mine FOR APPS AND READING IPAD MINI While I m really fond of the size price and performance of the Google Nexus 7 and Amazon Kindle Fire HD and love that the Sony Xperia Tablet Z is waterproof Apple s iPad Mini is still the tablet I find myself recommending to parents the most Oh sure we read everyday how quickly Android s catching up but iPads still offer the most robust selection of learning study and organizational apps overall It s also an easy way to access to digital textbooks as well as iTunes U which gives your student free easy access to college level courses as podcasts videos lecture notes and other media Best of all the iPad Mini has a mini ish price tag too starting at 330 There are of course great non Apple options out there for students of all ages so be sure to see our full story just on tablets for teens later this month FOR KEEPING IN TOUCH SMARTER SMARTPHONES Giving your child a smartphone may not seem like a great idea but it is

nestles in against your lower back and quite literally takes a load off It has a built in air pump to put more air in whenever and wherever you need The whole design alleviates the pressure pulling down on your shoulders while distributing weight more evenly throughout and resting more comfortably on your hips For this you ll pay around 60 FOR MUSIC ANYWHERE Satechi iFit 1 This speaker dock for your smartphone or tablet is compact and portable but still features the power to provide great sound wherever you need it with a battery that will last for up to six hours This gadget is compatible with most smartphones and tablets and best of all comes in at a bargain price of 16 FOR THE WOW FACTOR PEBBLE SMARTWATCH The Pebble Smartwatch is more for the college age student who wants to look both tech and fashion forward It s a great way to know what time it is and gives you a way to read to read texts e mails and get calendar notifications all on your wrist But if you or your student is prone to attention issues this could be a huge distraction since it vibrates and flashes social media alerts right on hang on a minute I m getting a text oh right your wrist Prices start at 150 FOR STUDENTS WHO STILL NEED A PRINTER EPSON ALL IN ONE There s been a great debate among the tech recommending crowd Do students still need printers or is a USB memory stick or trip to the nearest campus Kinko s enough I took that question to you the viewers and readers who overwhelmingly responded that YES many students still need the ability to print papers and projects and it s too inconvenient to go someplace to have them printed all the time For a decent printer that works wirelessly across most mobile devices the 99 Epson XP 410 is a fine choice Yes the ink will still be the biggest cost so

        "content": "HARRISBURG Pa AP The first civil claim brought against Penn State over child sexual abuse at the hands of former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky has been settled an attorney for one of Sandusky s victims said Saturday The Philadelphia Inquirer first reported that the young man known as Victim 5 who testified at Sandusky s criminal trial last year settled for several million dollars Attorney Tom Kline confirmed the deal in an email to The Associated Press but did not immediately provide any other details STUNNING QUOTES PSU players comment in new book The paper reported the deal is the first of 26 settlements expected soon among 31 young men who have pressed claims over the actions of Sandusky The Inquirer said it had interviewed Kline on Friday along with Michael Rozen one of the lawyers brought in by Penn State to resolve the civil claims Rozen told the paper that Victim 5 s case was considered to be more serious than others because his abuse occurred in August 2001 months after top school officials were informed by a graduate assistant that he saw Sandusky assaulting a boy in a team shower EARLIER Penn State ex officials face trial in abuse case The pivotal issue from the university s perspective in dealing with the victims is where the incident occurred and when it occurred proximate to the 2001 shower incident Rozen told the paper A spokesman for the university declined comment on the deal Saturday saying the school continues to make progress on multiple settlements Penn State announced a year ago the day Sandusky was convicted of 45 criminal counts that it hoped to compensate his victims fairly and quickly Sandusky 69 is serving a 30 to 60 year state prison sentence for child molestation and related offenses Penn State s trustees authorized some 60 million in settlements last month Victim 5 was among eight young men testified at Sandusky s trial last year about abuse that included grooming fondling oral sex and anal rape including incidents on school property Sandusky spent three decades at Penn State under former head coach Joe Paterno He met some of his victims through The Second Mile a charity for at risk youth he founded in 1977 and continued to operate after he retired from Penn State in 1999 A 1998 complaint about Sandusky showering with a boy one of those who testified against him was investigated by university police but no charges were filed A graduate assistant Mike McQueary witnessed a different incident in the team shower in 2001 and notified Paterno and other high ranking school officials but police were not called The response of university leaders including Paterno was heavily criticized in a report commissioned by the school last year Paterno died in January 2012 but criminal charges for an alleged cover up are pending against three others former president Graham Spanier retired vice president Gary Schultz and retired athletic director Tim Curley All three deny the allegations Penn State had fostered an image of a model football program under Paterno whose statue outside the football stadium was taken down after the scandal broke The school has spent nearly 50 million on the Sandusky scandal not including any payments to the victims and accusers Copyright 2013 The Associated Press All rights reserved This material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed",
