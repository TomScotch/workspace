they need to pack one around with them you ll want to find something that has an all day battery life is sturdy yet lightweight and small so that it can fit in a backpack and that won t be obsolete in a year or a two In this category it s hard to beat the MacBook Air which is as portable as they come the 11 inch model weighs just over 2 pounds and has truly extraordinary nine hours of battery life Prices start at 950 with student discounts Another great pick is the new Sony Vaio Pro 13 which is one of the best new ultrabooks I ve ever reviewed Its fourth generation Intel processor delivers ultra fast speeds masters the most demanding tasks and keeps the battery boosted all day long Prices on this little beauty start around 1 250 If you re on a tight budget and you d still like to get a lightweight laptop don t despair Samsung s 11 inch Chromebook starts at just 250 It s runs Google s Chrome operating system instead of Mac OS or Windows and focuses on running applications over the Internet This means the Chromebook could take a while to get used to but that s not a big deal since kids are so tech adaptable Overall it does a fine job doing most things your average student needs like researching topics online or writing papers with online tools like Google Docs FOR TAKING NOTES LIVESCRIBE SKY WI FI SMARTPEN Today s students have a modern equivalent of the No 2 pencil on steroids in the Livescribe Sky Wi Fi Smartpen It records a digital copy of what you write and draw as well as audio of your class lectures You just takes notes normally then later go back tap any word

I used bright pink duct tape for mine FOR APPS AND READING IPAD MINI While I m really fond of the size price and performance of the Google Nexus 7 and Amazon Kindle Fire HD and love that the Sony Xperia Tablet Z is waterproof Apple s iPad Mini is still the tablet I find myself recommending to parents the most Oh sure we read everyday how quickly Android s catching up but iPads still offer the most robust selection of learning study and organizational apps overall It s also an easy way to access to digital textbooks as well as iTunes U which gives your student free easy access to college level courses as podcasts videos lecture notes and other media Best of all the iPad Mini has a mini ish price tag too starting at 330 There are of course great non Apple options out there for students of all ages so be sure to see our full story just on tablets for teens later this month FOR KEEPING IN TOUCH SMARTER SMARTPHONES Giving your child a smartphone may not seem like a great idea but it is

nestles in against your lower back and quite literally takes a load off It has a built in air pump to put more air in whenever and wherever you need The whole design alleviates the pressure pulling

with most smartphones and tablets and best of all comes in at a bargain price of 16 FOR THE WOW FACTOR PEBBLE SMARTWATCH The Pebble Smartwatch is more for the college age student who wants to look both tech and fashion forward It s a great way to know what time it is and gives you a way to read to read texts e mails and get calendar notifications all on your wrist But if you or your student is prone to attention issues this could be a huge distraction since it vibrates and flashes social media alerts right on hang on a minute I m getting a text oh right your wrist Prices start at 150 FOR STUDENTS WHO STILL NEED A PRINTER EPSON ALL IN ONE There s been a great debate among the tech recommending crowd Do students still need printers or is a USB memory stick or trip to the nearest campus Kinko s enough I took that question to you the viewers and readers who overwhelmingly responded that YES many students still need the ability to print papers and projects and it s too inconvenient to go someplace to have them printed all the time For a decent printer that works wirelessly across most mobile devices the 99 Epson XP 410 is a fine choice Yes the ink will still be the biggest cost so

was unable to regain his control after walking Jordan Schafer on four pitches to open the second He s still kind of learning to deal with the adversities of pitching up here said Nationals manager Davey Johnson who also was ejected by plate umpire Marvin Hudson when he argued in defense of Strasburg When he went back out in the second inning I ve never seen his command so bad Johnson said He couldn t come close to the first hitter he faced Then he threw a curveball that was eight feet outside and then a couple balls that were behind the hitter It didn t look like he was trying to hit Simmons He couldn t find the strike zone Entering the game Strasburg had thrown three wild pitches in 146 1 3 innings He doubled that total by unleashing three consecutive wild pitches including the two behind Simmons back When Johnson and Strasburg were in the clubhouse after being tossed Johnson said he immediately sought to find out if his ace was hurt The first thing I said when we were both in here was Are you hurt Is something wrong with you Johnson said He said No I m just out of sorts VIDEO STRASBURG THROWS BEHIND SIMMONS The Nationals loaded the bases and scored two runs in each of the first two innings On a night when the game time temperature was 66 degrees Strasburg said he just got a little cold I was just missing spots Asked if it was a mechanical problem Strasburg said I can t really explain it I just didn t really feel good out there and couldn t hit the spot Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez said it was just weird to see Strasburg s suddenly unable to throw strikes He said he didn t think Strasburg was trying to hit Simmons I don t know if there s something wrong with him physically because it just didn t look right Gonzalez said It didn t look right LaRoche lifted a high fly ball into the right field seats for this 18th homer off Kris Medlen 10 11 who was pressed into service after Atlanta exhausted its bullpen The game lasted 5 hours 29 minutes Jason Heyward hit two homers including a two run shot in the ninth as Soriano blew a 7 5 lead Craig Stammen 6 5 allowed no hits in three scoreless innings striking out five with one walk Dan Haren pitched the 15th for his first career save Haren said he threw 30 to 35 pitches in his regular bullpen session before the game but didn t hesitate to volunteer for the rare relief appearance We needed a game like this Haren said Atlanta s Brian McCann had three hits including a two run homer Freddie Freeman also homered for the Braves Ryan Zimmerman hit a homer for Washington Each team used all its relievers Medlen scheduled to start Tuesday at the Mets made his first relief appearance of the season as Atlanta s ninth pitcher of the night Soriano suffered his sixth blown save Heyward s second homer of the game a two run shot to right center with two outs in the ninth sent the game to extra innings Braves pitchers hit Bryce Harper with two pitches in Atlanta s win on Friday night leaving the outfielder bruised and unable to start on Saturday night That set the stage for Strasburg Strasburg hit Upton in the first inning one pitch after Heyward s leadoff home run The pitch hit Upton s backside and he quickly ran to first Asked if he meant to hit Upton Strasburg said I m not going to get into that But the answer seemed clear Well after somebody goes deep and you hit him in the rear end I don t think it s a big deal Johnson said I don t know if he did it on purpose or not The second inning meltdown by Strasburg was more difficult to figure out The drama left Braves fans howling but no players emerged from either dugout There were no additional incidents in the game There were tensions between the teams that carried over from the Braves three game sweep at Washington on Aug 5 7 Both benches emptied when Harper was hit by a Julio Teheran pitch in the second game of the series Tanner Roark dominated the Braves after taking over for Strasburg Roark allowed only one hit in four scoreless innings He had a run scoring double in the fifth for his first major league hit and RBI Mike Minor allowed four runs in only 1 2 3 innings the shortest of his 78 career starts Minor gave up bases loaded two run singles to Wilson Ramos in the first and Jayson Werth in the second Harper was in Johnson s original lineup but was held out with bruised triceps until entering the game as a defensive replacement in the ninth Strasburg gave up two runs and two hits two walks and one hit batter in one plus inning Like Minor he also had the shortest start of his career Werth doubled off Luis Ayala in the sixth and scored on a single by Wilson Ramos NOTES Washington s Scott Hairston was ejected by Hudson in the ninth for arguing a called third strike The Nationals placed RHP Taylor Jordan on the 15 day DL with a lower back strain Tyler Moore was recalled from Triple A Syracuse and had two hits while starting at first base The Braves signed IF Tyler Greene to a minor league contract Greene released by the Chicago White Sox on Tuesday was assigned to Triple A Gwinnett 2B Dan Uggla who had corrective eye surgery on Friday said a test Saturday showed his vision at 20 15 He expects to be ready to play when eligible to come off the 15 day DL on Aug 28 The series concludes on Sunday when Nationals LHP Gio Gonzalez faces Atlanta s Julio Teheran Copyright 2013 The Associated Press All rights reserved This
