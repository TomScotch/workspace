    "text": "Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP\nHeading into Friday's news conference, President Obama had a delicate balancing act before him: how to acknowledge widespread concerns about National Security Agency surveillance without in any way legitimizing the actions of leaker Edward Snowden.\nThe best course, the president decided, was to acknowledge that Snowden's revelations to some degree forced his administration to accelerate and expand a review of the federal government's surveillance activities.\nBut Obama wanted to make clear that he, not some random event, set in motion the administration's policy review — even before details of the NSA data gathering involving phone records and Internet communications became public.\nThe president sought to rip off the hero's mantle some have placed on Snowden after his leaks began appearing in the Guardian newspaper: \"I don't think Mr. Snowden was a patriot. ... The fact is, is that Mr. Snowden's been charged with three felonies.\"\nIt also was a fact, however, and Obama spoke to it, that Snowden's disclosures did push the administration in ways it would have avoided if it could have.\n\"There's no doubt that Mr. Snowden's leaks triggered a much more rapid and passionate response than would have been the case if I had simply appointed this review board to go through — and I'd sat down with Congress and we had worked this thing through.\"\nThe president reminded his audience of his May speech when he addressed the use of drones and targeted killings in U.S. counterterrorism efforts.\nIt was then, before Snowden became a household name, that the president told the nation he had ordered a broad examination of the government surveillance.\nBut Obama's May message — the essence of which was \"we've got this\" — and the assurances since then clearly haven't tamped down enough of the fears or criticisms. Americans have become significantly less trusting of government assurances on civil liberties the more 9/11 recedes into the background.\nA recent Pew Research Center survey found half of Americans approving government anti-terrorism programs that collect telephone and Internet data, with 44 percent disapproving.\nBut for the first time since Pew Research began tracking it in 2004, Americans expressed more concern about restrictions of civil liberties going too far than protection from terrorism.\nAnd in a remarkable change since 2006, Pew found the same percentage of Democrats and Republicans — 38 percent — who agreed that the government's policies didn't go far enough to protect Americans. There was a 9-percentage point difference in 2006.\nPart of what we seemed to be witnessing with Obama was the education of a president, and the difference between having the ultimate responsibility of protecting the nation and being a legislator in the policymaking process.\nAs Obama himself acknowledged again Friday, when he was a senator during the Bush administration, he thought somewhat differently.\n\"Now, keep in mind that as a senator, I expressed a healthy skepticism about these programs,\" he said. He gave the strong impression that knowing what he now knows from sitting in the Oval Office, his inclinations run in a different direction.\nStill, he understood that though he may have thought the existing checks and balances were enough to assure Americans, he now realizes they're not. In explaining that he now gets it, the president arrived at what may have been one of the stranger metaphors he's used in some time, invoking the first lady and household chores.\nIt was a jarring version of Ronald Reagan's \"trust but verify\" and a comparison unlikely to come out of the presidential cupboard again. But the point was made.",

    "text": "Jacquelyn Martin / AP\nSen. Mitch McConnell undoubtedly had no illusions that he would be the ideal candidate of Tea Party conservatives.\nStill, the Republican leader in the Senate couldn't have expected what sounds like disdain from his own campaign manager.\n\"Between you and me, I'm sorta holding my nose for two years because what we're doing here is going to be a big benefit to Rand (Paul) in '16. So that's my long vision,\" Jesse Benton, the campaign manager, said during a phone call, secretly recorded early this year by a conservative activist, and recently published by Economic Policy Journal .\nBenton, a libertarian, has been a top campaign aide to both Ron Paul, the former congressman from Texas, and his son, the junior senator from Kentucky, who is talked of as a possible presidential candidate. Benton is also married to a granddaughter of the elder Paul.\nBenton, hired by McConnell 11 months ago, was supposed to be the Senate minority leader's emissary to Tea Party conservatives, especially now that he tries to get past a primary challenge from businessman Matt Bevin.\nBenton's words could prove damaging to McConnell if it gives enough Kentucky conservatives one more reason to vote against the four-term incumbent. And Benton tried to clean up the political mess in a statement released by the McConnell campaign:\nAll in all, it's not easy being McConnell right about now. He is viewed by many conservatives, including evidently his campaign manager, as an establishment Republican too ready to make deals with Democrats.\nIf it's too much for him to both grin and bear the diss by Benton, he at least has to bear it. Firing Benton would inflame exactly the voters McConnell was hoping Benton could soothe. So that doesn't appear to be an option.\nHe also has a feisty Republican primary foe who could require McConnell to burn through a lot of his $10 million war chest and, if the senator succeeds, soften him up for the Democrat.\nAnd that Democrat, Alison Lundergan Grimes, recently showed that she can deliver a devastating attack line when she said McConnell couldn't even \"pass a kidney stone.\" But more painful than that for McConnell might be a recent poll — albeit by a Democratic pollster – that found Grimes and McConnell essentially tied.\nStill, it's early and McConnell is an experienced political infighter. While The Cook Political Report has moved the race to toss-up status, Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball still favors McConnell to win the race.",

    "url": "http://www.npr.org/2013/08/09/210506171/the-butler-not-a-movie-its-a-movement-says-director",
    "text": "Anne Marie Fox / The Weinsten Co.\nLee Daniels has directed critically acclaimed films that deal with difficult subject matter before, but he says working on The Butler was \"the hardest thing he's ever done.\"\nThe film chronicles the life of a man who rose from the cotton fields of North Carolina to work in the White House, witnessing some of the most important moments in this nation's history.\nThe movie's main character, Cecil Gaines, is loosely based on the life of Eugene Allen, who worked at the White House for over three decades. Allen and his wife, Helene, were profiled by Washington Post writer Wil Haygood during the 2008 presidential election.\nDaniels and Haygood sat down with Tell Me More host Michel Martin to talk about The Butler, and the man who inspired it all.\nInterview Highlights\nOn the search for a witness\nIn the midst of the 2008 presidential campaign, journalist Wil Haygood had a feeling that Barack Obama was going to win. And he wanted to profile someone who had witnessed the civil rights movement from the 1960s to the present time.\n\"I just knew it was going to exhaust the hell out of me,\" Haygood says. \"I was just looking for anybody — a butler, a maid, somebody who washed the windows.\"\nHaygood made call after call, searching for someone who would fit the bill. Eventually he struck gold with Eugene Allen. \"I was under the impression he had worked for three presidents. He corrected me, and he said it was eight.\"\nOn the story's relationship with the civil rights era\nAlthough it delves into the civil rights movement, Daniels says that wasn't his initial intention. \"This story is really a love affair for me. A father-son love affair that transcended race. It wasn't until we started shooting some of the atrocities that happened in the South that I realized that this was on another level.\nDaniels described one scene in particular that stood out for him. \"We were shooting the bus scene; there were freedom riders on the bus. It was hot, it was a real bus, and I'm in the center of the bus with these kids on a bridge where black men were lynched.\"\nDaniels says that after yelling 'action,' actors playing the role of KKK members stormed the bus carrying burning crosses and yelling insults.\n\"I'm a little scared, and I think so were the actors on the bus, and I yell to the window 'cut.' But they can't hear me,\" says Daniels. \"And I realize — when it happened — there was no one to yell cut for these children, and that these kids were really fighting for the soul of our country, and that they were heroes in a way that I could never be. ... That's when I realized it was a bigger movie than just a father-son story. It's not a movie — it's a movement.\"\nOn why the story is relevant today\nDaniels says that when he makes a movie he goes into a cocoon and often disconnects from the outside world and news of the day to focus on painting an accurate historical picture. But he noted that the film's conversations about race are still relevant today. \"I come out, and Trayvon Martin is happening. It's out of body. It leaves me speechless. I'm at a sense of loss, because I did the movie, we end on hope. Cecil walking down, and Obama's speaking, and this glorious music, and those iconic words from those presidents are inundating us, and you know where are we?\"\nOn what the movie would mean to Eugene Allen\nAllen died in 2010 and wasn't able to see the film inspired by his life make it to the big screen. But Haygood thinks there's still something beautiful about that:\n\"To me, it's almost biblical. The last shall be first. The movie is about the butler. He's up in heaven. He can tell President Eisenhower, Truman, Kennedy, Johnson, Carter, Ford, Nixon, Reagan. He can tell them, 'Hey, we're having a movie in the theater of heaven tonight. It's called Lee Daniels' The Butler , and it's really not about any eight of you, it's about the guy who used to serve you the popcorn at the White House theater. It's about me. Have a seat.' I think that's beautiful.\"",

    "text": "Bonnie Osborne / Roadside Attractions\nDon LaFontaine had a voice anyone would recognize. As a voice-over artist, he recorded thousands of movie trailers and TV commercials, and became famous for his delivery of the phrase \"In a world,\" which kicked off countless trailers. He died in 2008, but the new comedy In a World ... — written and directed by actress Lake Bell — tells the story of voice-over artists competing to become the next LaFontaine.\nBell co-stars opposite Fred Melamed, who doesn't just play a voice-over artist — he is one, with any number of ads, trailers and TV-network commercials. He's an actor, too, perhaps best known for his performance as Sy Ableman in the Coen Brothers movie A Serious Man.\nBell, for her part, starred with Meryl Streep in It's Complicated, and co-stars on the Adult Swim comedy series Childrens Hospital. At this year's Sundance Film Festival, she won the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award for In a World ..., which casts her as a veteran voice coach who wants to break into the male-dominated world of voice-overs. One of the men she's competing with is her father, played by Melamed, who's already near the top of the field.\nBell and Melamed joined Fresh Air 's Terry Gross to talk about the attractions of voice-over work, researching an accent, and the perils of \"sexy-baby vocal virus.\"\nInterview Highlights\nOn what initially drew them to voice-over work\nBell: \"I always wanted to be an actor, [and] I guess it seemed like the ultimate acting to me. You know, the idea of blind voice was very alluring — because in a way you weren't judged by what you looked like, you could be any character and create any characterization. ... It's the only medium where you can be anyone, any social [level] , any nationality, any gender, for that matter.\"\nMelamed: \"I always felt, frankly, I couldn't stand the way I looked, and voice-over was an opportunity to play anything. ... [Voice-over acting] has always been my waitress job. I got out of drama school in 1981 ... and I've never had to have another job outside of being a performer. ... And it's strictly because I do voice-overs that I was able to tough it out through the periods [when] there was scant work, which is something that happens to all actors.\"\nOn how male and female voice-overs are used differently\nBell: \"If a man is selling you a car in a voice-over, it's like, 'Buy this car and you'll get to be me.' And if a woman is selling a car via the voice-over, then it's sort of, 'Buy this car and you'll get to be with me.' So it's this interesting dynamic.\"\nOn sexy voice trends through the ages\nBell: \"The vocal trend that is infecting the female youth in this fine nation is the sexy baby vocal virus. [It's] a huge problem for a myriad of reasons, one being ... is that sexy? Because ... I think [what] is intended is this submissive I'm-a-12-year-old-and-you-can-tell-me-what-to-do [thing], which I think is pretty weird, for that to be considered sexually enticing.\n\"But I think women of all ages adopted this thing. Whilst, when I was growing up and I first saw Lauren Bacall in a movie and I heard her voice — and Faye Dunaway and Anne Bancroft — I mean, that sounded hot to me. That sounded like something I wanted to aspire to. And I mean, Lauren Bacall is like 19 years old in To Have and Have Not , and she was talking like a Big Girl.\n\"[The sexy baby vocal virus] originate[d] and then festered from reality television, in some respects. ... I would love to talk to some of the ladies who are on reality-television shows. I have a fantasy of helping them find their true voice.\"\nOn researching what a Bulgarian woman educated in England sounds like\nBell: \"The first thing I thought was, obviously, I'm going to go to the embassy, because they have a lot of those kinds of people there. So I went out there — 20 years old with a tape recorder, an American to boot — and knocked on the door of the Bulgarian Embassy. I realized that ... perhaps it's not the ideal to dress all in black with a tape recorder and start asking questions in an embassy. You know, you gotta learn. There are growing pains. That didn't play out so great. I had to go to a Bulgarian restaurant, which are really hard to come by.\"\nOn Don LaFontaine's larger-than-life personality and work ethic\nMelamed: \"Don LaFontaine was famous for having a white stretch limo with the letters 'DLF' on the side with a little coronet, and he would run around from one studio to another all day. And this is before cellphones. He had a very expensive ship-to-shore phone, which is a thing that costs many, many thousands of dollars, that barely worked, that he had installed in his stretch limo. And he hooked up a fax machine to it, and while he was riding from, say, Fox to Columbia, he would have the next set of scripts faxed to him so he could rehearse. So by the time he got to the studio he could do it quickly, and he could go to the next studio. So his whole day was spent going from one studio to another. ... But there was nobody who came close to him in terms of the amount of work that he did or the money that he generated.\"",

    "text": "Charles Dharapak / AP\nPeople have been talking a lot lately about the National Security Agency. But there's another important \"NSA\" in the federal government — the president's national security adviser.\nThat person is a sort of funnel — gathering information from the military, the intelligence community, the State Department — and channeling it all to the president.\nSusan Rice has been in the job for only a month — but it's been one heck of a month. The day Rice started her new job, Egypt's military overthrew the Egyptian government. Then, the controversy surrounding leaker Edward Snowden blew up. And last week, with both of those fires still raging, another crisis pulled Rice and the national security team into the White House Situation Room: a terrorist threat that led to the closing of U.S. embassies and consulates in the Middle East and North Africa.\nThis latest threat has deep personal significance for the new national security adviser. Fifteen years ago this week, Rice was the State Department's undersecretary for African affairs when terrorists blew up two U.S. embassies in East Africa. Hundreds of people were killed and thousands wounded.\nPrudence Bushnell, who was the American ambassador to Kenya at the time, says the attack had \"a huge impact\" on Rice.\n\"I know it did because she came to visit a few months afterward,\" Bushnell says. \"You couldn't have been in the Department of State without having been impacted — and certainly not in African affairs.\"\nLast year, Rice was ambassador to the United Nations when terrorists struck again — this time in Benghazi, Libya. Four Americans were killed.\nFollowing that attack, Rice used talking points that were wrong on Sunday morning news shows. That mistake may have kept her from being nominated for secretary of state.\n\"Susan Rice should have known better,\" Republican Sen. John McCain said on Fox News, \"and if she didn't know better, she's not qualified.\"\nRice did not need Senate confirmation to be President Obama's national security adviser.\nThose crucible experiences shape the person Rice is today. She painfully learned the cost of not doing enough.\nBen Rhodes works closely with Rice as deputy national security adviser at the White House, where, he says, \"there's definitely a lean toward action because there's an understanding that there's really no margin for error.\"\n\"Action\" is a word that comes up a lot when people talk about Rice.\nHer predecessor, Tom Donilon, was extremely low-key. Nobody would describe Rice that way.\nInstead, people call her style \"energetic,\" \"no-nonsense\" or \"rigorous.\" At the White House, her meetings start and end on time.\nBruce Riedel of the Brookings Institution has known Rice for 20 years.\n\"If someone from an agency is giving her an inadequate answer or giving her the runaround, Susan's going to cut to the chase and say, 'Look, this is what I need to know,' \" he says.\nTommy Vietor, who was a White House national security spokesman during Obama's first term, says Rice gets \"into the weeds.\"\n\"She knows the details. She is tough and smart and will get your attention if you're slipping,\" Vietor says.\nWhen Rice arrived at the White House a month ago, she made a point to meet each person who works on the National Security Council, Rhodes says.\n\"And she's gone out of her way to make people know that their work is going to reach the president, and their voice is going to reach the president,\" he says.\nThat's one reason national security adviser is such a powerful job: She hears from everyone with a stake in the argument, but the president may hear only from her.\nVietor describes how a typical decision might play out — say, to close embassies around the world.\n\"The national security adviser is convening the broader national security apparatus and saying: FBI, CIA, State, Defense, come to the table and let's discuss this. Let's figure out all the implications of these decisions and then let's vote,\" he explains.\nAnd, he says, they do literally take a vote. \"The president gets a number of decisions every day that are unanimous, and he gets many others that are divided.\"\nSome national security advisers weigh in at stakeholder meetings, while others hold their counsel for the president. People in these meetings say, not surprisingly, that Rice expresses a strong view.\nDuring this harried month, folks at the White House say they have more than once heard the president joke with Rice about whether she's sure she wants the job.\nIt's not too late to back out, he tells her. She always replies: Happy to be here.",

We also revisit the work that appeared on this blog, and highlight what we're reading from our fellow technology writers and observers at other organizations.\nICYMI\nIn case you missed it ... here on All Tech, we looked at how Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' $250 million purchase of The Washington Post is the latest sign that the tech and media worlds are melding . Speaking of Amazon, Laura Sydell says the online retailer's foray into fine art doesn't have traditional galleries too worried. Elise Hu took a look at efforts by several states to write laws to cover what happens to your digital life after you die . And Laura noted how Apple is increasingly in Washington's sights .\nTom Bowman reported on technology being developed to give special ops troops Iron Man-like suits to protect them in battle. Elise followed up on the hackable Japanese toilet and learned that its app collects perhaps a bit TMI. Steve Henn examined the backlash against Twitter after threats and abusive messages targeted prominent women in the U.K. And Steve says another backlash is feared — this one against the new wireless emergency alert system after Amber Alerts startled millions of mobile phone users.\nDaniel Hajek reported on advertisers looking for an audience, six seconds at a time , on the Vine video app. Leslie Bradshaw, chief operating officer at the startup Guide, wrote about how women are having a bigger influence at the top of the tech industry, in their own way. And, finally, our weekly innovation pick was the Kite Patch , a sticker that hopefully makes you invisible to mosquitoes.\nWhat's Catching Our Eye\nIn no particular order:\nFast Company: This Tooth Sensor Puts Wearable Computing In Your Mouth\nSay aaaah. A researcher in Taiwan has developed an embeddable tooth sensor that can track your eating habits. Of course, a Bluetooth connection to smartphones is being contemplated so that people could monitor their diet through a health app.\nThe New York Times Bits Blog: YouTube's Founders Challenge Vine and Instagram With New Video App\nThe latest mash-up toy is here. Chad Hurley and Steve Chen, who brought YouTube to the world, have launched MixBit , an app that looks to do Vine and Instagram videos one better. Their new app lets you mix, edit and collaborate on videos — even those who didn't shoot — to create and share stories.\nBBC: Confused Xerox copiers rewrite scanned documents, expert finds\nThat's right, blame the machine. Some Xerox copiers are changing numbers on documents, according to a German computer scientist who found that scans he made of construction plans had altered room dimensions. Xerox said the problem is limited to scans made under a certain setting.",

But now Chinese Internet users have found a way to one-up nature: They're wrapping those already adorable babes in watermelons.\nYep, watermelons.\nApparently, the melon children meme started circulating in July, when this little guy dressed in watermelon overalls showed up on the streets of Wenzhou, a city in Zhejiang province, the Chinese news agency Xinhua reports.\nScreengrab from Xinhuanet\nPhotos of the tiny Wenzhou watermelon fashionista soon inspired a wave of online imitators, many looking dapper in melon caps, including this swashbuckling little tyke, according to Chinese media reports.\nWeibo/roll.sohu.com\n(In the middle of a record-setting summer heat wave , Chinese parents have to find something to amuse themselves, right?)\nAs Brian Ashcraft writes over at Kotaku, \"not all parents in China are dressing their kids in melon wear, and there isn't an army of watermelon children roaming the street. However, this does seem to be a thing.\" Duly noted.\nOf course, the concept of photographing produce-wrapped bundles of joy is hardly new. Photographer Anne Geddes became famous (and rich) with her iconic images of infants as pumpkins, peas in a pod and, you guessed it, watermelon babies. Perhaps Geddes will consider the current Chinese meme a more appropriate tribute to her art than this Vice spoof . (Oof!)",

    "title": "Did Tyson Ban Doping Cows With Zilmax To Boost Foreign Sales?",
    "url": "http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/08/09/210538430/did-tyson-drop-zilmax-fed-beef-to-appease-foreign-buyers",
    "text": "Peggy Lowe / Harvest Public Media\nTyson Foods Inc. announced this week that it would soon suspend purchases of cattle that had been treated with a controversial drug, citing animal welfare concerns.\nBut many in the industry wonder if the real reason is the battle for sales in other countries, where certain drugs that make livestock grow faster are banned.\n\"I really do think this is more of a marketing ploy from Tyson to raise some awareness so they can garner some export business from our overseas export partners,\" says Dan Norcini, an independent commodities broker.\nSurprising many in the industry, Tyson sent a letter to cattle feeders saying that as of Sept. 6, the company would no longer buy animals that had been treated with Zilmax , a drug that bulks up cattle by as much as 30 pounds just before slaughter. Tyson controls 26 percent of the U.S. beef supply and is the first company in the industry to make this change.\nThe letter cited recent reports of cattle being delivered for processing that couldn't walk or move.\n\"We do not know the specific cause of these problems, but some animal health experts have suggested that the use of the feed supplement Zilmax, also known as zilpaterol, is one possible cause,\" the letter said, adding that it wasn't a food safety issue.\nThe company that manufactures Zilmax, Merck Animal Health, issued a statement saying the product is safe.\n\"We are surprised by Tyson's letter,\" the statement said. \"We are confident that, based on all of the available data on Zilmax, the experience reported by Tyson is not attributable to Zilmax.\"\nZilmax, approved by the FDA for use in livestock, is a beta-agonist and acts as a steroid, turning fat into muscle. As the Chronicle of Higher Education reported in 2012, the drug can make meat tough and tasteless. But new reports have surfaced recently suggesting that cattle are growing so large — up to 1,300 pounds — that they can't walk.\nLilly Callaway, an animal scientist who works for JBS, the largest beef-producing company in the world, told a meeting of cattle producers in Denver this week that her company is seeing increasing reports of animals fed beta-agonists as stressed.\n\"Truck drivers have indicated that there is a difference between loading cattle depending on the beta-agonist status of the diet,\" she told Feedstuffs , a weekly agribusiness newspaper. \"Our plants have indicated that particular lots of cattle are showing up as 'tender-footed' — they do not want to move, seem lethargic and stiff, and have no energy.\"\nMike Callicrate, a Kansas cattle rancher and president of the Organization for Competitive Markets , a small group of beef producers fighting consolidation of the industry, says he wasn't surprised by Tyson's move. Consumers are growing increasingly aware of how their food is produced, he says, and they don't like what the use of what he calls \"performance-enhancing drugs\" to dope livestock.\n\"The Lance Armstrong, baseball-player type of compounds are precisely the same compounds being used in livestock production,\" he says. \"We have killed our export markets with the use of all these growth-promoting, growth-enhancing, performance-enhancing type drugs.\"\nChina, Russia and many countries in the European Union have banned the use of these drugs in meat production. In May, Smithfield Foods, the largest pork producer in the world, announced it would cut in half its purchase of animals raised with a similar drug, ractopamine. Just a week later, Smithfield announced its sale to a Chinese company.\nPatty Lovera, assistant director of Food and Water Watch in Washington, D.C., says she hopes that large companies' barring the use of such drugs will become a trend.\n\"It's a little bit unfortunate that it takes other countries having good standards to make an improvement in the U.S. marketplace,\" she said, \"but at this point we'll take what we can get, I think, when it comes to how we look at the drugs that are allowed to be given to food animals.\"\nBut not everyone is happy about Tyson's decision. The last few years have been tough on cattle ranchers and farmers. They've suffered through drought drying up their hay and grass, then watched as that weather killed off corn and sent feed prices sky high.\nNorcini, the commodities broker, says Zilmax was a godsend to producers, allowing them to feed the cattle less and get a better price thanks to the added pounds. He thinks Tyson is taking a big risk.\n\"They may appease or they may keep some people happy in ... the animal rights front. They may gain some followers and some accolades from that,\" he says. \"But I think the cattle industry as a whole is not going to look at this particularly in a good light.\"\nMeanwhile, Lovera and others wonder if Tyson is simply sending a message to all those countries now negotiating two large trade agreements with the U.S.\n\"This stuff is front and center in these trade negotiations so I just think it's really interesting to see a big player like this volunteer some change, probably to make export markets happy,\" she says.\nPeggy Lowe is a reporter for Harvest Public Media , a public radio reporting collaboration that focuses on agriculture and food production.",

Sexual Assault Services on July 31 and stole several computers and monitors apparently had a change of heart after finding out that the people at the agency help victims of sexual violence.\nThe next night, someone returned the stolen goods and also left behind a note, as the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services and local news outlets report. The note's message:\nCandy Stallings, the center's director, thinks she knows who spread the word that led to the stolen goods' return. After the burglary, police talked with homeless people in the area around the center's offices — \"explaining what our facility does and the services we provide to the community,\" she says. Stallings believes those homeless people then told others.\nLos Angeles' KABC-TV has a video report here . It adds that the agency \"is still out $5,000 because of damage that they will have to raise themselves.\" The agency is looking for help in covering those costs. Its website is here , and its Facebook page is here .\nUpdate at 7:30 a.m. ET, Aug. 9. How To Donate:\nThe agency says on its website that it is thankful for the \"outpouring of support.\" It also says it's been having trouble with its online donation tab. So it has set up a new page for online donations here . As Friday dawned, about $1,870 of the agency's $10,000 goal had been raised.\n(H/T to NPR's Kathy Rushlow.)\nReturn to the top of this post .",

    "title": "Why Picking Your Berries For $8,000 A Year Hurts A Lot",
    "url": "http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/08/07/209925420/why-picking-your-berries-for-8-000-a-year-hurts-a-lot",
    "text": "Courtesy of Seth Holmes\nAs the supply chain that delivers our food to us gets longer and more complicated, many consumers want to understand — and control — where their food comes from.\nBut even if we meet farmers at the farmers market , urban consumers are still largely divorced from the people who grow, pick and package our food. And we may even willfully ignore their suffering, argues Seth Holmes , a medical anthropologist and professor of health and social behavior at the University of California, Berkeley, in his provocative new book, Fresh Fruit, Broken Bodies .\nFor two summers between 2003 and 2005, Holmes lived on a farm in the Skagit Valley of Washington state. The farm produces strawberries, apples, raspberries and blueberries to sell to berry companies like Driscoll and dairy companies like Häagen-Dazs. He traveled there with a group of Triqui Indians, across the border from their hometown of San Miguel in Oaxaca, Mexico. As Holmes soon learned, the Triquis make up the very bottom rung of the agricultural labor ladder and earn between $5,000 to $8,000 a year.\nHolmes stayed in the camp with the other laborers, in a shack with a tin roof and no insulation. Over the winter, he traveled with the Triquis to Madera, Calif., to prune grapevines in a vineyard. In 2005, Holmes went back to medical school, but he has continued to visit the same workers nearly every year since.\nOn the berry farm, Holmes picked fruit once or twice a week; the Triqui workers picked seven days a week, rain or shine, without a day off. And that took a heavy toll on their bodies: back and knee pain, slipped disks, Type 2 diabetes, premature births. As one Triqui worker he calls Abelino told him, \"You pick with your hands bent over kneeling, your back hurts; you get knee pains and [hip] pains ... You suffer a lot.\"\nWe talked to Holmes about his time with the Triquis; here's part of our conversation, edited for brevity and clarity.\nWhat was the most surprising or shocking aspect of the food system that you uncovered in your research?\n\"Before I did the research, I had a sense of the hierarchy of people involved in the food labor chain. But over the course of the first five months, it became clear that the hierarchy is much more detailed and subtle. There are indigenous Mexicans [like the Triqui] who occupy the rung with the most demanding physical labor — they're the ones who are bent over picking. The mestizos operate the machines — that's not quite as demanding. Then the U.S.-born Latinos are in charge of some things, and use English and Spanish. The white Americans have the most control.\n\"What was troubling was that people on every rung of hierarchy are legitimizing and justifying it. Farmworkers are doing that, too.\"\nDo you think that hierarchy is representative of farms in other states in the U.S.?\n\"I think it is. The indigenous people from Mexico and Central America have the least powerful position. The system is different in California, because farms tend to hire a contractor to get big fields picked or pruned. The contractor goes out and finds laborers, and in my field research, I found that system to be worse in the sense that farmworkers are not paid directly by the farm. There's no paper trail. When we were in California, every time we pruned, we were paid less than minimum wage. With that system, labor laws are less likely to be enforced. But in Washington state, the farmworkers were hired directly by farmers, who were more likely to pay minimum wage.\"\nDo you think that the American public cares about the labor required to produce our food?\n\"We talk so little about the people who do the work that gives us the fresh fruit and vegetables that we want. Farmworkers are pretty hidden, and there's a concept from Jean-Paul Sartre, the French philosopher, called bad faith , meaning self-deception. My simplified version of that is that we consciously hide from ourselves the difficult realities of the workers. We somewhat know them, but we don't think about them much. In that way it seems like 'communal bad faith.' \"\nWhy do you think the people in the food movement calling for changes in the industrial food system don't talk much about the labor issues?\n\"On some level, a lot of the food movement is concerned with: How does this food affect me and my body? Are there hormones in it? Antibiotics ? Pesticides? But the workers who are harvesting the food and spraying the pesticides — their bodies are human, too. Ideally, we would think about them and what's going into that work. If there are ways that we, as consumers, can lend a voice towards farmworkers having health care that will protect the bodies that are working so hard to give us the healthy food we can eat, I think that's really important.\"\nSo you think the health care available to farmworkers is deficient?\n\"In Washington state and California, the people I met were pretty lucky to have independently run, grant-funded, nonprofit clinics to go to. But it's unclear what will happen with the Affordable Care Act. The law is wonderful in lots of ways, and will increase access for a lot of people, but there are no provisions for immigrants. Meanwhile, immigration reform is stalled , and it looks like part of the reason is that several representatives won't vote for reform unless newly legalized immigrants will not be eligible for full health care. But the people who are getting sick to help us get a healthy diet deserve health care.\"\nIt's clear from the book that you don't really blame the farm owners for the poor living and working conditions of berry pickers. As you write, \"The corporatization of U.S. agriculture and the growth of international free markets squeeze growers such that they cannot easily imagine increasing the pay of the pickers or improving the labor camps without bankrupting the farm ... many of the most powerful inputs into the suffering of farmworkers are structural, not willed by individuals.\"\n\"Sometimes it is fair for us to blame farm owners. But sometimes it isn't. We also have to look at the North American Free Trade Agreement, and other free trade agreements. In general, the problems in agriculture are long-standing.\"\nWhat do you think is the most important thing for consumers to know about the people behind their food?\n\"Farmworkers help us be healthy by harvesting fruits and vegetables, and they're helping the health of our economy by paying sales taxes and Social Security. But we are not prone to value their health or bodies or well-being. That seems disrespectful and unfair.\"",

    "text": "Mariana Dale / NPR\nWhen winemakers crush the juice from grapes, what's left is a goopy pile of seeds, stems and skins called pomace. Until several years ago, these remains were more than likely destined for the dump.\n\"The pomace pile was one of the largest problems that the wine industry had with sustainability,\" says Paul Novak, general manager for WholeVine Products , a sister company to winemaker Kendall-Jackson in Northern California.\nCurrently, some wineries compost the unwanted leftovers for their own use or to sell to gardeners. But now, scientists and entrepreneurs are finding new and often surprising uses for this former waste product.\nSome winemakers, for instance, are using pomace as the basis of grapeseed oil. Researchers are also exploring pomace's properties as a food preservative — studies have shown that compounds called polyphenols found in grapes and in pomace kill bacteria that can cause food to spoil. One Oregon State University professor, Yanyun Zhao , has even toyed with turning pomace into a biodegradable material to make flower pots.\n\"We're continuously looking for new options,\" says Zhao, who has spent several years studying pomace and its potential uses in and out of the kitchen.\nAnd right now, one of the most promising commercial uses of pomace is also one of the tastiest: It's being turned into a gluten-free flour substitute.\nWholeVine has partnered with a local miller to produce the flour, which comes in 16 different varieties based on the different wine grapes — such as chardonnay, Riesling and merlot — used to make it.\nThe journey from vine to oven begins in September with the harvest. WholeVine collects pomace left from after grapes are pressed. The seeds and skins need to be separated, dried and milled. The process takes place within a two-month period: Workers must move quickly to get the pomace dried and stabilized before mold takes hold and the polyphenols in pomace — which have been linked to many health benefits — start to degrade.\n\"There's a lot of nutrition and goodness that we are currently letting the mold get to and throw away,\" Novak says. \"We think that nutrition should be put into the system for humans.\"\nWholeVine says its products are also high in iron, fiber, protein and other nutrients. That's all well and good, but in order for the flour to have commercial success, it has to taste good, too.\nThere's good news on that end, says Oregon State's Zhao. Her testing has found that grape pomace flour can replace as much as 20 percent of regular flour in baked goods like bread, brownies and muffins without altering the taste or texture. Add more than that, though, and you can start to change the flavor of food (pomace flour can be bitter in large quantities).\nCan consumers taste the difference? At Washington State University, food science undergraduate Gena McKahan tested out reactions to granola bars made with anywhere from 0 to 15 percent grape pomace flour. Participants in a blind taste test, McKahan says, preferred the bars with 5 percent or less grape flour. Even that small amount of pomace flour, McKahan says, can add a significant amount of polyphenols to a sweet treat.\nRachel Klemek, a baker in Orange County, Calif., admits she was skeptical when, four years ago, a friend suggested she experiment with a purple powder in the kitchen. \"If it's not butter, sugar, flour or eggs, I don't want it,\" says Klemek.\nBut eventually, Klemek decided to mix what she called \"wine flour\" into basic recipes for baked goods and pasta. These days, you'll fine Klemek selling several flavors of cabernet brownies and violet-colored pasta at Blackmarket Bakery , the shop she runs in Costa Mesa, Calif.\nThe taste is slightly \"grape-y,\" she says. It retains the tannin quality of a cabernet sauvignon, the dryness associated with some red wines. I sampled several of her creations and can testify to their tastiness.\nRight now, only a fraction of the pomace produced nationally is meeting such a sweet afterlife. WholeVine's Novak says the goal is to create a market for its pomace-based products that will eventually allow the company to scale up operations.\n\"We are doing things,\" he says, \"that in essence, close the loop for sustainability for the fine wine industry.\"",

    "text": "Dominik Pabis / iStockphoto.com\nYou don't need to be a social scientist to know there is a gender diversity problem in technology. The tech industry in Silicon Valley and across the nation is overwhelmingly male-dominated.\nThat isn't to say there aren't women working at tech firms. Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer and Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook have raised the profile of women at high-tech firms. But those prominent exceptions do not accurately portray who makes up the engineering ranks at those and other tech companies.\nVisit Silicon Valley and you will hear many people talk about the need to increase the number of female hackers. The conventional wisdom about why there are so few female coders usually points a finger at disparities in the talent pool, which is linked to disparities in tech education . In fact, starting as early as adolescence, girls and boys often choose different academic paths. When the time comes for young people to elect to go into engineering school, serious gender disparities become visible .\nA new study by University of Texas sociologist Catherine Riegle-Crumb in the journal Social Science Quarterly offers an interesting new perspective on this divide. Along with co-author Chelsea Moore, Riegle-Crumb decided to dive into the gender divide in high school physics courses. (Even as the gender divide in some areas of science has diminished, a stubborn gap has persisted for decades in high school physics.)\nRiegle-Crumb had a simple question: The national divide showed boys were more likely to take physics than girls. But was this divide constant across the country?\nIn an analysis of some 10,000 students at nearly 100 schools, Riegle-Crumb found that the divide was anything but constant.\n\"What we find is that there are many schools where boys and girls take high school physics at the same rate,\" Riegle-Crumb said in an interview. \"And that there are many other schools where more girls actually take physics than boys. And so when you look at the aggregate, you see a pattern where boys are taking physics more than girls, but there is a lot of variation around that.\"\nThere are some obvious things that could cause those variations. If parents of some kids are scientists, or highly educated, they might push their daughters to take tough courses in high school. Wealthy families might be able to afford tutoring, or have one parent stay home to help kids with homework. Better funded suburban schools might be at an advantage over inner-city schools.\nBut when Riegle-Crumb controlled for those and other possibilities, she found one reason remained: \"What we found is that in communities that had a higher percentage of women in the labor force who are working in science, technology, engineering and math, that in those schools, girls were as likely as boys to take physics, or even more likely.\"\nRiegle-Crumb's finding about the importance of local role models meshes with a broad range of earlier work that shows the decision to pursue math and science is not about innate differences between boys and girls, but about social context and norms. Countries with greater gender equality , for example, reveal more equal math test scores among boys and girls.\nTeenage girls growing up in communities where women are better represented in tech are more likely to see women commenting on tech issues in public forums and in school discussions — and more likely to run into a friend's astrophysicist mom at a birthday party.\nBy contrast, Riegle-Crumb said, girls growing up in communities where most working women are in jobs traditionally held by women such as child care or nursing might not see the possibilities that exist.\n\"If I am a young woman growing up in a community or culture like that, then that's what I see as, 'Well, this is what I am expected to do,' \" Riegle-Crumb said. \"And so it may not ever occur to me, that, 'Oh, you know, I don't actually have to do that. There's a vast array of things I could choose to do.' But if no one around me is doing those things, it's hard for me to even consider that possibility.\"",

    "text": "Julie Brown/Seattle Children's Hospital\nAbout five years ago, emergency room doctor Julie Brown met an 8-year-old girl who complained about a weeklong stomach ache. The girl was tight-lipped about what might be causing the pain, and she ended up visiting the Seattle Children's Hospital, where Brown works, twice. And then a third time.\n\"When I examined her, she was sitting up and chatting with me,\" Brown tells Shots . \"She looked so well.\"\nThen, the young girl's doctors ordered an X-ray, and found something odd. \"She had a stack of magnets and batteries in her stomach,\" Brown says. \"She went right to the operating room, where they did an endoscopy. They only found a couple of them.\"\nThe doctors realized they would have to open her up and look for the rest. What they found was a minefield of tiny, round rare-earth magnets she had swallowed.\nA battery and a magnet were stuck together in her stomach, which caused an ulcer. A little further down the line in her gastrointestinal tract was another ulcer. The 8-year-old ended up losing about 10 centimeters of her intestines that had become seriously damaged.\n\"We actually do pretty well with less intestine, generally speaking,\" Brown says. \"But anyone who has had surgery involving opening the bowel has an increased lifelong risk of bowel obstruction due to adhesions . So it is definitely something we wish we could avoid.\"\nThe case pushed Brown, already interested in studying foreign objects in the body, to track kids who have an appetite for magnets.\nIn a recent study published in the Annals of Emergency Medicine , Brown and colleagues documented an increase in magnet-related ailments that eventually bring young people into the emergency room.\nUsing national emergency room data from 2002 to 2011, Brown and other researchers found a fivefold increase in young people (up to age 21) who swallowed magnets and wound up in the hospital.\nOver that period, there were about 22,500 injuries to kids from magnets. Most of the time, the magnets went through the mouth, but nearly a quarter of the injuries were caused when kids stuck magnets up their noses.\n\"The thing that motivated this research was what happened when the Consumer Product Safety Commission tried to get all of these makers of spherical magnet sets to take their products off the market,\" Brown says.\nLast summer, NPR reported the CPSC issued its first stop-sale order in 11 years. The products included those of Maxfield & Oberton , the since-liquidated maker of strong toy magnets called Buckyballs.\n\"The national data are usually sparse on details about the nature of the magnet,\" Brown says. \"But, there are a lot of magnets available in the community now than there were previously.\"\nA lot more.\nAbout 3 million sets of Buckyballs magnets were sold in the U.S. from 2010 on, which is also when Brown saw an increase in Seattle cases involving magnet ingestion.\n\"My local study showed a similar pattern of increase that the national study showed, and all the increases were in the years between 2010 and 2012,\" Brown says.\nHer Seattle Children's Hospital study collected more detailed information about each magnet-related injury, including type of magnet. By 2012, about two-thirds of ingestions were caused by spherical balls from magnet sets that look a lot like Buckyballs. That's up from 25 percent in 2010.\n\"We did find the increase could be explained by Buckyballs-type magnets,\" she says.\nMost of the incidents involve young children, but there was also a rise among older ones, including teens. But why the uptick in magnets being swallowed by teens? Shouldn't they know better?\nIt turns out they're not gobbling magnets like younger kids. Instead, she says, they're mostly using them to mimic body piercings , like, say, a nose or tongue stud. And while these older kids are out looking cool, sometimes those little round magnets come loose. Next thing you know they're in the stomach or lower. Definitely not cool.",

    "text": "Bob Child / AP\nA few weeks back, Sharon Roberts, who had been diagnosed with endometrial cancer last year, tweeted:\nThe 55-year-old teacher in Houston was surprised when @aetnahelp , a Twitter account created for customer assistance by the insurance company Aetna, quickly responded.\nThrough Twitter and subsequent phone calls, Aetna clarified that she didn't need to take the more expensive test, and then figured out that she had been charged double by her hospital for other treatments.\n\"If I hadn't put out that snarky tweet about the BRCA test back in July, I would have probably just set up a payment plan to the hospital and paid out that bill,\" she said. The experience appears to bring new meaning to the company's catchy old ads featuring the tagline, \"Aetna, I'm glad I met ya!\"\nThe @aetnahelp Twitter feed is an example of how insurance companies are increasing their social media presence to deal with customers. The accounts also help companies manage their brands and do quick damage control for complaints.\nThe accounts, which include @askanthem , @cignaquestions and several accounts for various Blue Cross Blue Shield companies around the country, are often separate from larger company accounts that focus on marketing and general health care news.\n\"Social media gives us a tremendous opportunity to learn what the community needs,\" said Carissa O'Brien, social media director at Aetna.\nShe works with six people to address the approximately 250 people who seek help through social media with claims or other services each month. O'Brien said the team tries to respond within an hour to users.\nLast year, Aetna made news when CEO Mark T. Bertolini engaged in an extended Twitter conversation with colon cancer patient Arijit Guha who said his insurance didn't cover his treatment.\nAt the end of a publicized debate and Guha's campaign, which he dubbed \"Poop Strong,\" Bertolini directed Aetna to pay Guha's medical bills, and tweeted: \"The system is broken, and I am committed to fixing it.\" Guha died in March .\nO'Brien said the social media team learned from the case, and that it eventually reinforced their \"commitment to interacting with our customers and members on the channels where they already are.\"\nGuha's case was out of the ordinary. The day-to-day fare doesn't earn personal responses from the CEO. Questions come in about financial woes or health plan coverage. And there are more than a few complaints:\nIn both cases, the companies responded to these queries with resources or further contact information to resolve the issues.\nThough companies are accustomed to fielding feedback and questions from their customers, the public nature of a platform like Twitter or Facebook can also be a call for accountability, said Ini Augustine, head of SocialWise Media Group .\n\"Social media acts as a public documentation of how you resolve the situation,\" she said. \"It's more than a marketing tool.\"\nAugustine predicts that the implementation of the health law in the coming months will spur the companies to use their platforms further, from organizing Twitter chats to engage customers, to answering questions about Obamacare for a new demographic.\nWhile insurance companies are hoping to connect with their customers through social networks, they aren't dropping call centers. Teeing off on Twitter is often just a gateway for a phone call or private message, since many personal questions can't be answered through a public forum.\nNevertheless, O'Brien said the company learns more about their customers through this medium, allowing them to respond more efficiently, whether it is through the phone or interview.\nShe said there is an added benefit of using the platform to educate and inform their community about health and wellness, especially during a time of many changes in the health care system. Even so, O'Brien said it's just the beginning.\n\"If we're looking to focus a 100-plus-year-old company on social media, that's massive cultural change,\" she said.",

    "text": "Courtesy of Stephen Hoffman/Sanaria Inc.\nA viable, effective vaccine against malaria has long eluded scientists. Results from a preliminary study have ignited hope that a new type of vaccine could change that.\nThe experimental vaccine offered strong protection against malaria when given at high doses, scientists report Thursday in the journal Science .\nThe study was extremely small and short-term. And the candidate vaccine still has a long way to go before it could be used in the developing world.\nNevertheless, Dr. Anthony Fauci , who leads the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, calls the findings unprecedented.\nThe vaccine, called PfSPZ, protected 12 of the 15 volunteers from malaria , including all six who received the high dose. By contrast, 11 of the 12 participants who weren't vaccinated came down with malaria.\n\"It's true to say that this is really impressive to have this degree of protection,\" Fauci says about the results. \"But on the other hand you have to temper it by saying the numbers are still relatively small.\"\nThe trial needs to be replicated on a far larger scale, he says. And it's still unknown how long the malaria protection lasts.\nThe participants in this study were all bitten by five mosquitoes infected with the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum three weeks after getting the vaccine shot.\nBecause everyone got exposed at the same time, this study wasn't designed to show how PfSPZ works over time. For any vaccine to be successful in the field, it would need to ward off the disease for years after the inoculation. Three weeks would be way too short.\nPrevious experimental vaccines have shown some effectiveness against the malaria parasite, but none have provided high levels of protection against the disease. In November, another candidate vaccine showed disappointing results in tests among young infants, though it provided children moderate protection against the parasite.\nPfSPZ is different from these previous vaccines because it uses whole, weakened parasites to trigger an immune response, instead of just a small part of the parasite, like a protein on its surface.\n\"We don't have any vaccines against parasitic infections like malaria because the parasite is so complex. It changes itself in your body. It morphs from one stage to the next,\" says Stephen Hoffman, the CEO of the Rockville, Md., company Sanaria , which developed PfSPZ.\nSpecially, PfSPZ gets certain immune cells, called T cells, to attack the parasite directly, instead of relying primarily on an antibody response.\n\"The idea that somehow one is going to make a vaccine that just attacks one of those thousands of proteins, and that's going to provide long-term protective immunity has always seemed odd to me,\" he says. \"But that's what all the other approaches are about.\"\nSanaria is moving quickly to conduct larger scale trials of PfSPZ in Africa. A study in Tanzania is slated to start in six weeks.\nIf things go well with the upcoming trials, Hoffman says, the earliest the vaccine might be available for widespread use would be in late 2017 or early 2018.",

    "text": "Lucasfilm/Coppola Co/Universal\nThis is the first of a series of stories produced in collaboration with Youth Radio on the changing car culture in America.\nWhen you're a teenager, there are many things you desperately want to find: friends, fun, a future, freedom.\nIn American Graffiti, the iconic movie about teenagers set in 1962, the kids find all of that just by getting in their cars. The teenagers spend a whole lot of time tooling around in their cars — looking, cruising.\nBut the deep relationship between American teen culture and the automobile depicted in the film has changed. Young people are driving less, getting their licenses later and waiting longer to purchase their first new car.\nThe movie was set — but not filmed — in Modesto, Calif., and I wanted to see if any part of the city was like the movie. So on a hot Friday and Saturday summer night, I drove around Modesto.\nWith its downtown and long, wide streets, the city seems a perfect place to cruise. But that's not what's happening.\nCelene Murrillo and her friends were among the many teens getting dropped off at the movie. Murrillo is 19, and she doesn't have a driver's license.\n\"If there was something that was out there forcing me to get out there and actually get my license, I probably would,\" she says. \"But there's, like, your parents, so you have something to depend on — and so maybe that's why.\"\nShe says her parents don't mind dropping her off around town — and she doesn't mind it either.\nBlanca Correa, 16, doesn't have a driver's license, and she has no immediate plans to get one. \"I've never actually thought it was that important,\" she says.\nCorrea says she gets around by asking friends for rides, and if it's important, her parents will give her a lift.\nMurrillo and Correa don't see the car as independence. They're not alone.\nBuying a car, even a used one, is difficult for teens, who aren't financially independent. But getting a driver's license — that's different. That's kind of a sign of intent. Twenty years ago, two-thirds of kids had a license by age 18, according to AAA ; but only about half do now.\nBut what about young people in their early 20s who tend to have more financial independence? To help answer that, I talked to four young adults: Megan Kurtz, McKenzie Yates, Katie Gilles and Mike Clubb. Of the four, only one owns a car. (Yates is 18; the other three are in their early 20s.)\n\"I better always have a car, 'cause how else would you get places? I better have a car,\" Kurtz says.\nClubb says he wishes he could afford a car. \"My girlfriend drives me everywhere. That sounds sad, and 20 years ago I'd be considered pathetic, but it's almost normal now to be that way,\" he says.\nGilles says cruising just to cruise — even in Modesto — is a thing of the past. The young adults say wandering around your town has given way to documenting your life — on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Gilles says young people in Modesto definitely drive, but it's with a different purpose.\n\"They're not likely to just aimlessly go,\" Gilles says.\n\"It has to be Instagram-worthy,\" Clubb adds.\n\"It has to be worth their popularity,\" Gilles says. \"They have to cross an event off their list.\"\nIn modern-day Modesto, cars are vitally important — but not in the same way they were in American Graffiti . They don't represent freedom, individuality, a rite of passage or a way to meet up with friends.",

And polls report rising concern about the effect of anti-terrorism policies on civil liberties.\n\"It fits very well with those who want to defend the NSA,\" says Tom Sanderson, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, an international policy think tank.\nStill, Sanderson doesn't believe that the leak was about answering Snowden's criticisms with proof of NSA effectiveness — or transparency.\nInstead, he and other observers say it's part of a time-honored tradition of administrations leaking information in hopes of putting their own actions and decisions in the best possible light.\n\"It's not unusual for administrations to try to justify what they're doing when they're getting criticized,\" says Gary Schmitt, a former staff director for the Senate Intelligence Committee. \"I wouldn't guess it was connected to Snowden, per se.\"\nMore A bout Benghazi Than Snowden?\nIt's possible that the administration, or someone in the government, felt it was necessary to offer a compelling and public justification for closing embassies and other diplomatic outposts in more than 20 countries.\nThe \"cloud\" of Benghazi, Libya, where four Americans were killed last September in an attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission, may have hovered over this particular leak, Sanderson suggests.\n\"They were a bit surprised by the criticism they got for closing all of the embassies,\" says Schmitt, who now directs a security studies center at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. \"They're certainly more conscious of embassy security issues than they were, absent Benghazi.\"\nThere's also a parallel with another moment in Libya. After the U.S. bombed the compound of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in 1986, the Reagan administration similarly leaked information about intercepted communications that showed Libya was connected to a discotheque bombing in Berlin that killed an Army sergeant named Kenneth Ford.\n\"You can go back and back and back to find these [kinds of] leaks,\" Schmitt says.\nPolitical Motivations\nThe latest leaks may have represented an attempt to find political cover, but the leaks themselves have earned the administration some criticism .\nThere have been complaints that the leaks have tipped off al-Qaida, and other terrorists, about its ability to listen in on their communications.\nThe administration also has been accused of hypocrisy , putting out such a big leak just after prosecuting Bradley Manning within an inch of his life for leaking huge amounts of classified documents.\nAnd the Justice Department had been criticized this spring for snooping on Associated Press reporters in the wake of a story about another al-Qaida plot.\nLeak As Rorschach Test\nWhat all this really underscores is the sensitive and highly politicized nature of the fight against terrorism — and the Obama administration's response to it.\nAn administration that has touted its efforts to sideline al-Qaida is now having to cope with the reality of its refusal to fade away.\n\"We took these pretty extreme measures, closing all these embassies and sending cargo planes to Yemen to get people out,\" says Peter Juul, a policy analyst with the Center for American Progress, a progressive think tank.\nJuul says the person or persons who leaked the information about intercepts wanted to build public confidence, \"to make sure people know what their intelligence agencies are doing and not having them run off on wild speculation about why we're closing embassies, scratching their heads or being actively paranoid.\"\nBut it's difficult to know for sure what the motivations were behind leaks that were not only anonymous, but also quite conceivably lacked the blessing of top officials of the White House.\nInstead of being simply reassuring, this one set of leaks managed to speak to concerns held from various points of view — whether it's the fear that the administration isn't capable of protecting Americans abroad, or the belief that NSA spying is helping to do just that.\n\"Unfortunately, politics has entered into this, as it always does,\" says Sanderson, the CSIS analyst.",

    "text": "Foley / AP\nEvery year, the U.S. Congress appropriates more than $1 billion in military aid to Egypt. But that money never gets to Egypt. It goes to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, then to a trust fund at the Treasury and, finally, out to U.S. military contractors that make the tanks and fighter jets that ultimately get sent to Egypt.\nThe U.S. started sending M1A1 Abrams tanks to Egypt in the late '80s. In all, the U.S. sent more than 1,000 tanks to Egypt since then — valued at some $3.9 billion — which Egypt maintains along with several thousand Soviet-era tanks.\n\"There's no conceivable scenario in which they'd need all those tanks short of an alien invasion,\" Shana Marshall of the Institute of Middle East Studies at George Washington University, told me.\nA thousand tanks would be helpful for large land battles, but not for the threats facing Egypt today, such as terrorism and border security in the Sinai Peninsula, according to Robert Springborg, an expert on the Egyptian military at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif. In fact, he said, at least 200 of the tanks the U.S. has sent to Egypt have never been used.\n\"They are crated up and then they sit in deep storage, and that's where they remain,\" he told me.\nThe story with F-16 fighter jets is similar. Since 1980, we've sent Egypt 221 fighter jets, valued at $8 billion. \"Our American military advisers in Cairo have for many years been advising against further acquisitions of F-16s,\" Springborg said. Egypt already has more F-16s than it needs, he said.\nI asked the State Department why the U.S. is giving Egypt weapons against the advice of its own military personnel. (The State Department, along with Congress, gives final approval on the weapons we send to Egypt.) Regarding those unused tanks, an official told me via email, it's not usual for a country to \"maintain a portion of its equipment in reserve in the event of security contingencies.\" The U.S. decides which weapons to send to countries like Egypt \"in consultation with our partners' own determination of their strategic and force structure requirements,\" the email added.\nI met with a high-ranking official in the Egyptian military who confirmed that the Egyptian military does request those tanks and fighter jets because it believes they're crucial for Egypt's security. And, he said, \"the U.S. wouldn't have given us weapons they didn't want us to have.\"\nThe U.S. wants Egypt to have them in part because of people like Bruce Baron, president of Baron Industries, a small business in Oxford, Mich. \"The aid that we give to Egypt is coming back to the U.S. and keeping 30 of my people working,\" Baron told me. Specifically, he said, 30 of his 57 employees are working on parts for the M1A1 Abrams tanks that we give to Egypt.\nEvery March for the past few years, Baron says, he and other small-business owners have gone to Capitol Hill at the invitation of General Dynamics, a big contractor. They visit their congressmen and \"let them know of our support for these programs and also the impact that these programs have on employment,\" he says.\nFormer Republican congressman Jim Kolbe often received visits from military contractors like Baron. Before he retired in 2007, Kolbe was the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that approves the military aid we give to Egypt. But when I talked to Kolbe recently, he said that \"legitimate questions need to be asked of the Egyptian military.\"\n\"What is the objective of of the military these days? What do you see as the real threat?\" he said.\nIn a perfect world, he said, the U.S. wouldn't be sending more F-16s and M1A1s to Egypt. \"I think the Egyptian military needs to be doing more hard thinking about some of those things,\" Kolbe said. \"Big toys are things that generals and military people like to have around.\"\nBut, Kolbe said, the State Department doesn't want to upset the status quo, the Defense Department doesn't want to upset a valuable ally in the region, and, of course, defense contractors want to keep their contracts.",

    "text": "David Goldman / AP\nThe U.S. Postal Service lost some $16 billion last year and continues to bleed red ink. Congress has been unable to agree on a rescue plan.\nThe latest proposal would allow the post office to end Saturday delivery in a year and enable it to ship wine and beer.\nThe Postal Service's woes are familiar: People don't really send letters anymore, so first-class mail is down, and Congress makes the post office prepay future retiree benefits to the tune of $5.5 billion a year.\nDemocratic Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware says the Postal Service is on the verge of financial collapse.\n\"The Postal Service can't continue to bleed money, to run up its tab at the Treasury,\" says Carper, who heads the Senate panel with oversight of the Postal Service. \"The Postal Service owes more than $15 billion to the Treasury — and the ticker's still running.\"\nPlus, he says, there are \"7 or 8 million jobs in the country that depend on a strong, viable Postal Service. And this is one that can be fixed.\"\nCarper's fix? The Postal Reform Act, co-sponsored with the panel's top Republican, Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma. The measure would allow the post office to eliminate Saturday service in a year, and to reduce the number of mail-processing centers in two years. It would also allow the post office to ship alcoholic beverages, opening up a new revenue stream, and to reduce somewhat the pension prepayments.\nCarper says the Postal Service suffers from too much capacity and too many workers, just like the auto industry used to.\n\"What they've done is they have right-sized their enterprise,\" he says of the carmakers. He says the Postal Service needs to do the same.\n\"They don't have the kind of market share that they used to have,\" he says. \"First-class mail volume has continued to drop. That's where they've made their money over the years.\"\nCoincidentally, the post office unveiled some new stamps Thursday, commemorating American workers. Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe used the occasion to praise postal workers.\n\"Our employees do a very good job, and work very hard every day to keep mail moving, keep packages moving, across the country,\" Donahoe said.\nBut there are far fewer postal employees than there once were, and under Carper's proposal, there would be fewer still. So the American Postal Workers Union has taken to the airwaves, running an ad urging Congress not to cut employees, but to change the way the Postal Service funds its pension obligations.\nThe ad says the problem is \"a burden no other agency or company bears — a 2006 law that drains $5 billion a year from post office revenue while the Postal Service is forced to overpay billions more into federal accounts.\"\nGreg Bell, vice president of the American Postal Workers Union, says the prefunding of retiree health benefits doesn't make sense.\nBell says the union supports a bill sponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, that would end the post office's prefunding requirement but otherwise keep the Postal Service relatively unchanged.\nThe Senate approved a Postal Service overhaul last year, but the House never acted. Meanwhile, the losses continue to mount.\nCarper is optimistic the House will approve its own bill soon, setting the stage for the two chambers to find some middle ground.",

    "text": "Matt Rourke / AP\nCommotion over a pair of movies that haven't even been made proves, if anything, that the Clintons need not lift a finger to inspire a controversy.\nThat said, the hubbub over a planned CNN documentary and a proposed NBC Entertainment miniseries on Hillary Clinton, the former first lady and secretary of state, does feel somewhat premature. Clinton hasn't said whether she intends to run for president in 2016.\nBut it's never too early to take a Democratic Party titan down a few pegs, especially one who polls well ahead of all Republican presidential possibilities.\nThat's one way to read the warning from Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who told CNN and NBC they have until Aug. 14 to decide against running what he has called \"puff pieces\" meant to put wind in Clinton's political sails. If not, Priebus says, he'll ask the RNC to vote to ban NBC and CNN from holding 2016 GOP primary debates and will push to hurt their chances of hosting actual presidential debates.\nAnother way to read the RNC threat is as a chance to rev up the conservative base for fundraising purposes.\nAnd some have read it as Priebus wanting to reduce the number of Republican primary debates from 2012's cavalcade of two dozen to something more manageable. He may be secretly hoping that CNN and NBC will move ahead with the projects, the theory goes, thus cutting down on outlets to host debates.\nAsked about this in a Post TV interview , Priebus said his real concern was the promotion of a Clinton candidacy.\nDavid Brock, the one-time conservative anti-Clintonite who underwent a conversion and started the progressive Media Matters for America, agrees with Priebus that the projects raise fairness questions.\nBrock wrote to NBC Entertainment and CNN officials asking them to reconsider. New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd wrote that Priebus \"has a point.\" Leo Hindery, a Democratic political activist and businessman, has also agreed with Priebus, saying on Bloomberg News' \"Street Smart\" program: \"It is simply wrong to do this.\"\nBoth CNN and NBC have politely suggested that their critics may be jumping the gun. CNN asked Priebus and the RNC in a statement to \"reserve judgment\" on the documentary; NBC gave the Hollywood Reporter a statement, saying, \"it would be premature to make any statements or draw any conclusions at this time\" about the miniseries.\nWhile it might be worth waiting for the films to actually be made before declaring that they would benefit Clinton, criticism could influence the filmmakers to err on the side of more negativity. So it could be a smart move all the way around for Priebus.\nBoth movies reportedly would air next year, well before the 2016 presidential race. Timing is important because of the federal equal-time rule, which requires that if a broadcast or cable outlet shows a documentary featuring a legally qualified candidate once the campaign for an office is officially underway, it must give equal time to other candidates for that office.\nAnd regardless of timing, the fictional mini-series, unlike the documentary, wouldn't trigger the equal-time law unless the real Clinton popped up somewhere in it, like in a cameo, according to an FCC official, who spoke on condition that his name not be used.\nWhile it seems unlikely that Clinton would pop up in the fictional mini-series, what does seem likely is that the current controversy is just a dress rehearsal for many to come if she decides to seek the presidency.",

    "text": "Jacquelyn Martin / AP\nSen. Mitch McConnell undoubtedly had no illusions that he would be the ideal candidate of Tea Party conservatives.\nStill, the Republican leader in the Senate couldn't have expected what sounds like disdain from his own campaign manager.\n\"Between you and me, I'm sorta holding my nose for two years because what we're doing here is going to be a big benefit to Rand (Paul) in '16. So that's my long vision,\" Jesse Benton, the campaign manager, said during a phone call, secretly recorded early this year by a conservative activist, and recently published by Economic Policy Journal .\nBenton, a libertarian, has been a top campaign aide to both Ron Paul, the former congressman from Texas, and his son, the junior senator from Kentucky, who is talked of as a possible presidential candidate. Benton is also married to a granddaughter of the elder Paul.\nBenton, hired by McConnell 11 months ago, was supposed to be the Senate minority leader's emissary to Tea Party conservatives, especially now that he tries to get past a primary challenge from businessman Matt Bevin.\nBenton's words could prove damaging to McConnell if it gives enough Kentucky conservatives one more reason to vote against the four-term incumbent. And Benton tried to clean up the political mess in a statement released by the McConnell campaign:\nAll in all, it's not easy being McConnell right about now. He is viewed by many conservatives, including evidently his campaign manager, as an establishment Republican too ready to make deals with Democrats.\nIf it's too much for him to both grin and bear the diss by Benton, he at least has to bear it. Firing Benton would inflame exactly the voters McConnell was hoping Benton could soothe. So that doesn't appear to be an option.\nHe also has a feisty Republican primary foe who could require McConnell to burn through a lot of his $10 million war chest and, if the senator succeeds, soften him up for the Democrat.\nAnd that Democrat, Alison Lundergan Grimes, recently showed that she can deliver a devastating attack line when she said McConnell couldn't even \"pass a kidney stone.\" But more painful than that for McConnell might be a recent poll — albeit by a Democratic pollster – that found Grimes and McConnell essentially tied.\nStill, it's early and McConnell is an experienced political infighter. While The Cook Political Report has moved the race to toss-up status, Larry Sabato's Crystal Ball still favors McConnell to win the race.",
