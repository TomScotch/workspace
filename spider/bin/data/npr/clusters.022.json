          "But even if we meet farmers at the ",
          "farmers market",
          ", urban consumers are still largely divorced from the people who grow, pick and package our food. And we may even willfully ignore their suffering, argues ",
          "Seth Holmes",
          ", a medical anthropologist and professor of health and social behavior at the University of California, Berkeley, in his provocative new book, ",
          "Fresh Fruit, Broken Bodies",
          ".",
          "For two summers between 2003 and 2005, Holmes lived on a farm in the Skagit Valley of Washington state. The farm produces strawberries, apples, raspberries and blueberries to sell to berry companies like Driscoll and dairy companies like Häagen-Dazs. He traveled there with a group of Triqui Indians, across the border from their hometown of San Miguel in Oaxaca, Mexico. As Holmes soon learned, the Triquis make up the very bottom rung of the agricultural labor ladder and earn between $5,000 to $8,000 a year.",
          "Holmes stayed in the camp with the other laborers, in a shack with a tin roof and no insulation. Over the winter, he traveled with the Triquis to Madera, Calif., to prune grapevines in a vineyard. In 2005, Holmes went back to medical school, but he has continued to visit the same workers nearly every year since.",
          "On the berry farm, Holmes picked fruit once or twice a week; the Triqui workers picked seven days a week, rain or shine, without a day off. And that took a heavy toll on their bodies: back and knee pain, slipped disks, Type 2 diabetes, premature births. As one Triqui worker he calls Abelino told him, \"You pick with your hands bent over kneeling, your back hurts; you get knee pains and [hip] pains ... You suffer a lot.\"",
          "We talked to Holmes about his time with the Triquis; here's part of our conversation, edited for brevity and clarity.",
          "What was the most surprising or shocking aspect of the food system that you uncovered in your research?",
          "\"Before I did the research, I had a sense of the hierarchy of people involved in the food labor chain. But over the course of the first five months, it became clear that the hierarchy is much more detailed and subtle. There are indigenous Mexicans [like the Triqui] who occupy the rung with the most demanding physical labor — they're the ones who are bent over picking. The ",
          "mestizos",
          " operate the machines — that's not quite as demanding. Then the U.S.-born Latinos are in charge of some things, and use English and Spanish. The white Americans have the most control.",
          "\"What was troubling was that people on every rung of hierarchy are legitimizing and justifying it. Farmworkers are doing that, too.\"",
          "Do you think that hierarchy is representative of farms in other states in the U.S.?",
          "\"I think it is. The indigenous people from Mexico and Central America have the least powerful position. The system is different in California, because farms tend to hire ",
          "a contractor",
          " to get big fields picked or pruned. The contractor goes out and finds laborers, and in my field research, I found that system to be worse in the sense that farmworkers are not paid directly by the farm. There's no paper trail. When we were in California, every time we pruned, we were paid less than minimum wage. With that system, labor laws are less likely to be enforced. But in Washington state, the farmworkers were hired directly by farmers, who were more likely to pay minimum wage.\"",
          "Do you think that the American public cares about the labor required to produce our food?",
          "\"We talk so little about the people who do the work that gives us the fresh fruit and vegetables that we want. Farmworkers are pretty hidden, and there's a concept from Jean-Paul Sartre, the French philosopher, called ",
          "bad faith",
          ", meaning self-deception. My simplified version of that is that we consciously hide from ourselves the difficult realities of the workers. We somewhat know them, but we don't think about them much. In that way it seems like 'communal bad faith.' \"",
          "Why do you think the people in the food movement calling for changes in the industrial food system don't talk ",
          "much",
          " about the labor issues?",
          "\"On some level, a lot of the food movement is concerned with: How does this food affect me and my body? Are there hormones in it? ",
          "Antibiotics",
          "? Pesticides? But the workers who are harvesting the food and spraying the pesticides — their bodies are human, too. Ideally, we would think about them and what's going into that work. If there are ways that we, as consumers, can lend a voice towards farmworkers having health care that will protect the bodies that are working so hard to give us the healthy food we can eat, I think that's really important.\"",
          "So you think the health care available to farmworkers is deficient?",
          "\"In Washington state and California, the people I met were pretty lucky to have independently run, grant-funded, nonprofit clinics to go to. But it's unclear what will happen with the Affordable Care Act. The law is wonderful in lots of ways, and will increase access for a lot of people, but there are no provisions for immigrants. Meanwhile, immigration reform ",
          "is stalled",
          ", and it looks like part of the reason is that several representatives won't vote for reform unless newly legalized immigrants will not be eligible for full health care. But the people who are getting sick to help us get a healthy diet deserve health care.\"",
          "It's clear from the book that you don't really blame the farm owners for the poor living and working conditions of berry pickers. As you write, \"The corporatization of U.S. agriculture and the growth of international free markets squeeze growers such that they cannot easily imagine increasing the pay of the pickers or improving the labor camps without bankrupting the farm ... many of the most powerful inputs into the suffering of farmworkers are structural, not willed by individuals.\"",
          "\"Sometimes it is fair for us to blame farm owners. But sometimes it isn't. We also have to look at the North American Free Trade Agreement, and other free trade agreements. In general, the problems in agriculture are long-standing.\"",
          "What do you think is the most important thing for consumers to know about the people behind their food?",
          "\"Farmworkers help us be healthy by harvesting fruits and vegetables, and they're helping the health of our economy by paying sales taxes and Social Security. But we are not prone to value their health or bodies or well-being. That seems disrespectful and unfair.\""

It goes to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, then to a trust fund at the Treasury and, finally, out to U.S. military contractors that make the tanks and fighter jets that ultimately get sent to Egypt.",
          "The U.S. started sending M1A1 Abrams tanks to Egypt in the late '80s. In all, the U.S. sent more than 1,000 tanks to Egypt since then — valued at some $3.9 billion — which Egypt maintains along with several thousand Soviet-era tanks.",
          "\"There's no conceivable scenario in which they'd need all those tanks short of an alien invasion,\" Shana Marshall of the Institute of Middle East Studies at George Washington University, told me.",
          "A thousand tanks would be helpful for large land battles, but not for the threats facing Egypt today, such as terrorism and border security in the Sinai Peninsula, according to Robert Springborg, an expert on the Egyptian military at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif. In fact, he said, at least 200 of the tanks the U.S. has sent to Egypt have never been used.",
          "\"They are crated up and then they sit in deep storage, and that's where they remain,\" he told me.",
          "The story with F-16 fighter jets is similar. Since 1980, we've sent Egypt 221 fighter jets, valued at $8 billion. \"Our American military advisers in Cairo have for many years been advising against further acquisitions of F-16s,\" Springborg said. Egypt already has more F-16s than it needs, he said.",
          "I asked the State Department why the U.S. is giving Egypt weapons against the advice of its own military personnel. (The State Department, along with Congress, gives final approval on the weapons we send to Egypt.) Regarding those unused tanks, an official told me via email, it's not usual for a country to \"maintain a portion of its equipment in reserve in the event of security contingencies.\" The U.S. decides which weapons to send to countries like Egypt \"in consultation with our partners' own determination of their strategic and force structure requirements,\" the email added.",
          "I met with a high-ranking official in the Egyptian military who confirmed that the Egyptian military does request those tanks and fighter jets because it believes they're crucial for Egypt's security. And, he said, \"the U.S. wouldn't have given us weapons they didn't want us to have.\"",
          "The U.S. wants Egypt to have them in part because of people like Bruce Baron, president of Baron Industries, a small business in Oxford, Mich. \"The aid that we give to Egypt is coming back to the U.S. and keeping 30 of my people working,\" Baron told me. Specifically, he said, 30 of his 57 employees are working on parts for the M1A1 Abrams tanks that we give to Egypt.",
          "Every March for the past few years, Baron says, he and other small-business owners have gone to Capitol Hill at the invitation of General Dynamics, a big contractor. They visit their congressmen and \"let them know of our support for these programs and also the impact that these programs have on employment,\" he says.",
          "Former Republican congressman Jim Kolbe often received visits from military contractors like Baron. Before he retired in 2007, Kolbe was the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that approves the military aid we give to Egypt. But when I talked to Kolbe recently, he said that \"legitimate questions need to be asked of the Egyptian military.\"",
          "\"What is the objective of of the military these days? What do you see as the real threat?\" he said.",
          "In a perfect world, he said, the U.S. wouldn't be sending more F-16s and M1A1s to Egypt. \"I think the Egyptian military needs to be doing more hard thinking about some of those things,\" Kolbe said. \"Big toys are things that generals and military people like to have around.\"",
          "But, Kolbe said, the State Department doesn't want to upset the status quo, the Defense Department doesn't want to upset a valuable ally in the region, and, of course, defense contractors want to keep their contracts."

          "WholeVine has partnered with a local miller to produce the flour, which comes in 16 different varieties based on the different wine grapes — such as chardonnay, Riesling and merlot — used to make it.",
          "The journey from vine to oven begins in September with the harvest. WholeVine collects pomace left from after grapes are pressed. The seeds and skins need to be separated, dried and milled. The process takes place within a two-month period: Workers must move quickly to get the pomace dried and stabilized before mold takes hold and the polyphenols in pomace — which have been linked to many health benefits — start to degrade.",

          "There's good news on that end, says Oregon State's Zhao. Her testing has found that grape pomace flour can replace as much as 20 percent of regular flour in baked goods like bread, brownies and muffins without altering the taste or texture. Add more than that, though, and you can start to change the flavor of food (pomace flour can be bitter in large quantities).",
          "Can consumers taste the difference? At Washington State University, food science undergraduate Gena McKahan tested out reactions to granola bars made with anywhere from 0 to 15 percent grape pomace flour. Participants in a blind taste test, McKahan says, preferred the bars with 5 percent or less grape flour. Even that small amount of pomace flour, McKahan says, can add a significant amount of polyphenols to a sweet treat.",

          "About five years ago, emergency room doctor Julie Brown met an 8-year-old girl who complained about a weeklong stomach ache. The girl was tight-lipped about what might be causing the pain, and she ended up visiting the Seattle Children's Hospital, where Brown works, twice. And then a third time.",

          "Then, the young girl's doctors ordered an X-ray, and found something odd. \"She had a stack of magnets and batteries in her stomach,\" Brown says. \"She went right to the operating room, where they did an endoscopy. They only found a couple of them.\"",
          "The doctors realized they would have to open her up and look for the rest. What they found was a minefield of tiny, round rare-earth magnets she had swallowed.",
          "A battery and a magnet were stuck together in her stomach, which caused an ulcer. A little further down the line in her gastrointestinal tract was another ulcer. The 8-year-old ended up losing about 10 centimeters of her intestines that had become seriously damaged.",
          "\"We actually do pretty well with less intestine, generally speaking,\" Brown says. \"But anyone who has had surgery involving opening the bowel has an increased lifelong risk of bowel obstruction due to ",

          "Over that period, there were about 22,500 injuries to kids from magnets. Most of the time, the magnets went through the mouth, but nearly a quarter of the injuries were caused when kids stuck magnets up their noses.",

          "\"We did find the increase could be explained by Buckyballs-type magnets,\" she says.",
