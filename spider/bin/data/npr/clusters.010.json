          "The president reminded his audience of his May speech when he addressed the use of drones and targeted killings in U.S. counterterrorism efforts.",
          "It was then, before Snowden became a household name, that the president told the nation he had ordered a broad examination of the government surveillance.",
          "But Obama's May message — the essence of which was \"we've got this\" — and the assurances since then clearly haven't tamped down enough of the fears or criticisms. Americans have become significantly less trusting of government assurances on civil liberties the more 9/11 recedes into the background.",
          "A recent Pew Research Center ",
          "survey",

          "But for the first time since Pew Research began tracking it in 2004, Americans expressed more concern about restrictions of civil liberties going too far than protection from terrorism.",
          "And in a remarkable change since 2006, Pew found the same percentage of Democrats and Republicans — 38 percent — who agreed that the government's policies didn't go far enough to protect Americans. There was a 9-percentage point difference in 2006.",
          "Part of what we seemed to be witnessing with Obama was the education of a president, and the difference between having the ultimate responsibility of protecting the nation and being a legislator in the policymaking process.",

In explaining that he now gets it, the president arrived at what may have been one of the stranger metaphors he's used in some time, invoking the first lady and household chores.",
