THE Boxing Day sales have started early as retailers desperately try to claw back profits after one of the worst years for the sector in decades.

Aggressive discounting by as much as 50 per cent across entire stores triggered a late surge in sales this week.

But major retailers will now try to take advantage by starting their Boxing Day sales online on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.

Shoppers, expected to spend $1.37 billion in Queensland in this year's sales, can access Myer's annual stocktake sale online from 8pm (Queensland time) today.

A number of major fashion retailers also plan to follow suit.

David Jones, however, will not allow online shopping until stores open at 9am Sunday.

Queenslanders are expected to spend $20 million more in this year's stocktake sales, up from $1.35 billion last year.

Nationally, the Australian Retailers Association predicts we'll spend $7 billion, excluding food.

Queensland has been one of the worst-performing states in retail all year and department stores have been one of the hardest-hit sectors.

In the year to May, department store sales fell 5.82 per cent after dropping 4.73 per cent in April, 3.15 per cent in March and 5.28 per cent in February.

Myer spokesman Mitch Catlin said that while the year had been challenging, shoppers had benefited from substantial pre-Christmas discounting.

But the department store remained confident consumers would be out in force for the annual stocktake sales.

Myer Queensland manager Jamie Mackay expected this year's stocktake sales would outstrip last year's, continuing an annual trend.

He said strong gift card sales before Christmas indicated more shoppers would hit the stores on Boxing Day or later.

"We've had fantastic gift card sales. The stocktake sales are a very strong event and continue to grow year on year," Mr Mackay said.

Myer also reported an increase in store traffic this week, as shoppers responded to aggressive discounting in the lead-up to Christmas.

He said stores in holiday destinations, in particular, were doing well this week.

A survey of retailers by the Australian Retailers Association last week showed a total of 65 per cent were trading below last year's levels.

Discounts of up to 50 per cent this week by fashion retailers have been common, leading to speculation that Australia's big two department stores will drive discounts to as much as 70 per cent on Sunday.

Australian National Retail Association chief executive Margy Osmond said retailers were hoping Gen Y shoppers, noticeably absent during the past year, would be lured back by the sales.

Save your strength for Sunday assault
BOXING Day bargain hunters need stamina and strategy to make the most of the sales this year, insiders say.

Even the most seasoned shoppers could benefit from a few key tips to getting the most out of the post-Christmas sales rush, according to Westfield Insider blogger Alyce Cowell.

"I'd advise to do your research – make a plan of attack of things you want to buy and have a budget to stick to it," Miss Cowell said.

"It's always great to make a list of what you want or things you know you'll need.

"The best things to look for are things you're going to need, like homewares, work clothes, birthday presents, Christmas decorations . . . they're always heavily discounted right after Christmas."

Miss Cowell said that with many sales already in full swing, it was worth having another look after Christmas.

"I'm finding a lot of things have gone on sale before Christmas but then they normally get discounted again for Boxing Day sales," she said.

"You don't always have to go in store, either, there's online shopping on the Westfield site now and something like 3000 brands to choose from."

David Jones regional manager Rowena Derksen said that while there was likely to be an initial rush on Sunday morning, there would still be plenty of bargains available later in the day.

"There are thousands of offers so don't rush, take your time as there are literally millions of products for everyone," she said.

"Take advantage of extended trading hours."
