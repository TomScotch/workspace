Good news, developers: version 2 of the foursquare API is now ready for you to play with. We’ve been working on this for almost a year, and, while it’s still in beta, it’s looking awesome. Trusted testers have been using it for a while and it passed a significant milestone with this week’s hot new Android client, the first app built entirely on the new API.

You’ll find APIv2 better in lots of subtle ways:

OAuth2 is much easier to use, more secure for users, and can even be used entirely from client-side Javascript.
By dropping XML support, we’ve been able to make the server more responsive (but not 1000x faster; sorry).
There’s extensive documentation that includes sample applications and an API explorer.
A lot of work was put into consistency and clarity.
And last but not least, we’ve added oft-requested new endpoints for fetching user’s badges, user’s venue histories, and venue popularity.
We’re well aware that there are many other things you want from our API (push notifications, venue management, and better venue search and trending information, among others), and we’re working on adding those features. But we believe this is a step in the right direction, making it even easier to build cool applications for our five million enthusiastic users and giving you incomparable access to our repository of millions of curated venues and user-created tips and hundreds of millions of check-ins.

You can learn more at our new developer homepage, developer.foursquare.com. Be sure to send any feedback or questions along to our developer mailing list.

P.S. We don’t have a concrete timeline for deprecating APIv1 (it will be a few months), but we’re encouraging all developers to use APIv2 going forward.
