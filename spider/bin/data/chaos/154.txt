BOOZE will be flowing until 5am tonight after dozens of Queensland's licensed venues received special permission to stay open late for New Year's Eve.

The state has granted extra hours to nearly 50 bars and clubs, with half open until dawn.

Liquor Licensing Minister Peter Lawlor said it "made sense" for venues to trade later because New Year's Eve was a big celebration.

Bars and clubs normally close between 2am and 3am.

Mr Lawlor said all premises can trade until 2am – regardless of licence. Patrons must finish drinks and leave by 2.30am.

Venues that wanted extra hours applied to Liquor Licensing by early December.

Of the about 50 that applied, half wanted to stay open until 5am.

Meanwhile, Queensland police will boost its enforcement to control alcohol-fuelled violence.

Alcohol-fuelled violence has been a major issue in Queensland, with multiple fatalities from king hits, stabbings and glassings.

Hundreds of police officers and liquor compliance officers will be out in force cracking down on drunken behaviour, violence and underage drinking. Police will concentrate on entertainment precincts using special units, such as dogs squad, mounted police and water police.

South Bank is expected to be the centre of Brisbane's celebration, with fireworks drawing up to 80,000 revellers.

On the Sunshine Coast, more than 40,000 revellers are expected to attend a free beachside carnival at Mooloolaba.

The event, which features live music, street entertainment and fireworks at 8.30am and midnight, is alcohol free and will be patrolled by more than 90 police officers and an equal number of security guards.

On the Gold Coast, the Glitter Strip prepares for its biggest-ever fireworks bonanza to farewell 2010 and welcome the new year.

The tourist city's tallest building, Q1, will again be the base for the fireworks spectacular with the Gold Coast's elite heading to an exclusive party at Jupiter's Casino.

Gold Coast City Council will also stage several fireworks displays along the length of the Coast.

Gold Coast Police Acting Superintendent Paul Ziebarth said people needed to avoid situations that might lead to violence.

"If you get into a potentially aggressive situation, walk away," he said. "One punch can kill."

A regular Friday transport timetable will operate, along with extra train, bus and ferry services tonight in Brisbane.

Fifty extra trains will run throughout the night, with 39 departing Brisbane after midnight on Beenleigh, Caboolture, Cleveland, Ferny Grove, Gold Coast, Ipswich, Shorncliffe and Sunshine Coast lines.

Most lines will be being serviced at least every hour.

The Bureau of Meteorology's Brisbane forecast for Friday is fine with an expected high of 29.
