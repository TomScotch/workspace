QUEENSLAND motorists are on track to usher in the New Year with the best gift of all  the lowest road toll in almost six decades.

There has not been a fatal accident since Monday, keeping the 2010 toll at a record low of 247 as of last night. That means 83 fewer people have died than at the same time last year.

If the luck – and good driving – holds, the state will have recorded its lowest road toll since 1952.

But the police and emergency services were not rejoicing the accomplishment last night.

They feared more fatalities could happen overnight and today as New Year's Eve parties get into full swing.

Authorities yesterday pleaded with motorists not to drink and drive and also to drive to the conditions – or not get behind the wheel at all.

Police Deputy Commissioner Ian Stewart was particularly critical of the behaviour of some motorists during the ongoing floods, with many drivers having to be rescued after ignoring signs warning of closed roads.

There were several accidents across Queensland yesterday as the wet weather persisted in many districts, but none resulted in serious injuries.

New statistics released yesterday showed only one police district from the Gold Coast to Torres Strait has recorded more road deaths this year than last.

The exception to the state's outstanding year on the roads was the district from the Brisbane River to Logan City. So far this year it has had 24 deaths, which is four more than the same time in 2009.

The North Coast district was down 31 on last year, Central Coast was down 17 and the the Southeast District, which includes Logan and the Gold Coast, also dropped.

The national holiday road toll climbed to 33 late yesterday.
