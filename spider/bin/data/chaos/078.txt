GLENDALE, Ariz. -- The Phoenix Coyotes' offense accomplished as much in one period against the Los Angeles as it had in the previous four games.

Shane Doan scored two goals and Scottie Upshall and Keith Yandle each had three points in the Coyotes' 6-3 victory over the Kings on Wednesday night. The Coyotes set season highs for goals in a game and goals in a first period with four - matching their total from their previous four games.

"Every day is a new challenge for us," coach Dave Tippett said. "Going forward, the consistency has to be better."

Doan has 36 two-goal games in his NHL career, but has never had a hat trick. The Phoenix captain also scored twice in a Dec. 11 home game against Dallas.

Upshall had a goal and two assists, all in the first period, and Yandle had three assists.

"In this game, we showed our identity," Upshall said. "We're a hardworking team, but to be successful, we also have to be a full 60-minute team."

Brett MacLean scored his first NHL goal in his first game, and Ray Whitney and Kyle Turris added goals for the Coyotes. With three forwards out, MacLean was recalled from San Antonio and placed with Turris and Mikkel Boedker. The line immediately energized a lethargic offense, and picked up two goals.

MacLean connected on a power play in the first period, crashing the to the net from the right side to convert a pass from Upshall.

"For me to score at this level, that's what I need to do," MacLean said. "I work hard on every shift, and try to make things happen."


The last previous Phoenix player to score his first NHL goal in his first NHL game was Daniel Winnik against the Blues on Oct. 4, 2007.

Brad Richardson, Marco Sturm and Ryan Smyth scored for Los Angeles.

Unlike most teams, the Coyotes were able to get to Jonathan Quick, and early. In his previous 26 games, Quick allowed four goal in a game only twice, and gave up five in a 6-4 loss to St. Louis on Dec. 16. Coming into this game, Quick had a 1.88 goals-against average, second only to Boston's Tim Thomas. After Turris completed the scoring at 10:03 of the second, Kings coach Terry Murray pulled Quick for Jonathan Bernier.

"We didn't play in any area of the game," Murray said. "All the goals allowed were not the fault of Quick. There were several mistakes out there, and the responsibility of others."

Notes

The loss dropped the Kings to 7-24-3 in their last 34 games in Phoenix.
The Kings are in the middle of a 12-game stretch against Western Conference opponents.
Coyotes forward Martin Hanzal was scratched. He's day-to-day with an upper-body injury.
With two assists, the Kings' Anze Kopitar has six points in his last three games.
