As promised, the Android update is here for the holidays! It’s got all the same features as the new photos and comments version for the iPhone, and a couple of extra goodies: two foursquare widgets for your home screen.

The new hotness is the addition of photos and comments:

Comments make meeting up and exploring so much easier. Improve your day by telling a friend that you’re around the corner and they should swing by. Getting a last-minute comment reminding you to order the best dish saves your meal. (You can even comment on the website and from check-in links posted to Facebook and Twitter!)
Photos change everything. Share moments with friends, see a venue and dishes before you leave the house. Your cute puppy pics! (and tips with attached photos are coming in the next update)
The past comes to life. You can visit your history page on foursquare.com to see all the places you’ve been, with photos and comments preserved. Remembering is more fun than ever.
In addition, there are two exclusive Android home screen widgets: one to enable quick check-ins, and one to see your friends’ latest activity.



We’ve received a ton of great feedback from iPhone users, and have been working around the clock on this update (literally – we have one Android developer in NYC and one in Australia). We’re both extremely excited and pretty tired; hope you enjoy this!

Visit the Android marketplace now to download it (or scan this barcode).



Happy holidays from team foursquare!

P.S. Once again, we’ll have BlackBerry and WebOS in early January, and all other platforms in early 2011.
