We’ve been rolling out a bunch of new things lately and, thus, haven’t spent much time talking about our core foursquare badges. Time for some badge love: we roll out a ton of these, and they’re broken up into two groups. First, we have the surprise ones, which users unlock when they do certain things. While we don’t really talk about these, but you’ll probably see stories or tweets about them.

The other type are badges we use to encourage and reward certain behaviors. Think the Gym Rat badge, which helps motivate and reward people for going to the gym. Here are a few of the many we’ve introduced recently:

Dog’s Best Friend – for frequenting dog parks
Great Outdoors – for getting out to parks to breathe in some fresh air
Swimmies – for the aquatic minded
9 to 5 – for those of us in the weekly grind
Hangover – we’re not encouraging hangovers, but are happy to salute people who keep on trucking!
Ski Bum – to commemorate your trips up the mountain


For those of you who love earning new badges, you can also see many of these ‘encouragement’ badges in your trophy case; if you hover over any locked badge (the ones that are grayed out), you’ll get hints to help you earn it.

These are only a few of the many badges we’ve rolled out as we continue to match badges to activities that you love. Going forward, we’ll introduce many of these new badges on Twitter, so make sure you’re following @foursquare. Happy exploring!
